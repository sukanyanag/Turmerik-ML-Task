health,Comment on: ‘Ozempic babies’: Reports of surprise pregnancies raise new questions about weight loss drugs,"Ozempic and Mounjaro are part of a class of drugs called GLP-1 receptor agonists, which act by mimicking hormones in the gut involved in insulin regulation and appetite. They’re both approved to treat type 2 diabetes, and each have twin medicines approved for weight loss. Ozempic uses the active ingredient semaglutide, and Wegovy is the version approved for weight loss. Mounjaro uses tirzepatide, which also targets a second hormone called GIP, and Zepbound is its brand name for weight loss.

The medicines have been shown to help people lose 15% to 20% of their body weight, on average, in clinical trials. And because of the way GLP-1 drugs work, experts say, there are reasons they may lead to more pregnancies as well as cause for caution about their use in early pregnancy.

Numerous women have shared stories of [“Ozempic babies”](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/08/health/ozempic-babies-pregnancy/index.html) on social media. But the joy some experience in discovering pregnancies may come with anxiety about the unknowns, as these medicines haven’t been studied in people who are pregnant.

“We don’t know the effect of early exposure … on the fetus,” said Dr. Jody Dushay, a physician focused on endocrinology and metabolism at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School.

Dushay said she recommends that women stop taking these drugs two months before trying to get pregnant, as directed in their prescribing information.",l36qsp6

AskDocs,"  The Nurse said ""call me on my cell instead of hitting the button to get me faster""","My sister in law went to the ER with breathing problems which ended up as a multi week hospital stay because she was diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer in the and had to stay in the hospital to have her lungs cleared out (I don't know what with I'm not a doctor myself).  She had her first dose of chemo but hasn't come home yet. 

We visited her this morning and the nurse said something along the lines of asking us to call her cell phone to get her rather than the button which seemed weird at the time.

Sure enough when my sister in law hit the button to ask for help to go to the restroom no one showed up.  She hobbled over and did it herself and hours later the nurse did show up and doped her up to the point where she could barely form a sentence when my inlaws showed up.  She hasn't eaten all day and the room was full of stale food and the whole place smelled apparently when they got there and they were furious which led to my wife and I thinking of that conversation in the morning about calling the nurse on her cell phone.  Is she just wandering off somewhere to chill rather than manning her station?

Is this normal?  Is the whole ""hit me up on my cell"" for a nurse assigned to man a station in a hospital a red flag?  This seems weird to me but I don't have any experience with the medical system.",1cp7u6a
AskDocs,My dad is using my name to get prescription drugs,"My sister visited my dad (60M) recently and she found a prescription bottle with my name on it in his bag. When I was 15 I was prescribed ADHD medication but I am 22 now. He has struggled with addiction in the past, and years ago I was aware of him taking my adderall. But I stopped using any ADHD medication when I was 17 so I figured he had no more access as (I thought) we had stopped refilling them. 

I think he has been getting them refilled somehow because I don’t know how to explain the full bottles of my pills that are everywhere in his house. I moved to Florida 3 years ago and he lives in Las Vegas. 

Is there a way to find out if he is getting my prescriptions filled? And what do I do? I’m just lost and have no idea what to do.

AskDocs,I'm afraid for my husband's life and I don't know what else to do.,"THIS IS A LONG POST I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT!!


First off this post is about an incredibly sensitive subject that has to do with use of a controlled substance.

Also, this may be a long one so thanks to anyone who takes the precious time from their busy day just to read this.


My husband was in a motorcycle accident way back in 2006.


His back of course was damaged and he was left with fractures, herniated discs, nerve damage etc.
My husband is a 45 years old
He is 5""7 and 255 pounds.

In 2008 he underwent back surgery, a Laminectomy and was pretty damn good for a while, until he wasn't. 

His whole personality began to change once the pain came back. His GP would fill a pain prescription here and there and sent him to physical therapy which he did and never missed an appointment.

Eventually...

He was approved for disability in 2012 and was sent to pain management for help where he received more physical therapy, spinal injections and steroids and a non narcotic pain prescription. 


Eventually after I believe 6 months they bumped him up to a controlled substance, hydrocodone. So he continues this for a few years and around 2014 he gets a spinal stimulator in his spine plus another laminectomy.

We were so freaking hopeful that the stimulator would work and be a miracle, but sadly it was a flop.

His pain management doc tells us he now has something they call "" failed back surgery syndrome"" Oh...ok?

So they do more shots!! They up his now narcotic pain meds to higher dose and he's acting like his old self again! He did have to go in for urine tests which he always passed.

We were going for walks, he could sit and stand comfortably...and then pain management doctor told him he was leaving and sent him to a place called medication management where they continued his pain prescription for a little while until the doc said my husband should be on Suboxone.


My husband who was ALWAYS polite and just a good sport said he'd do anything to not be in pain so he begins to go off his hydrocodone and finally gets put on Suboxone.

First of all his insurance didn't pay for it at the time so we paid out of pocket!

He took his first dose and vomits. Doc says it could be normal as his body may slightly still be going through withdrawals. 5 days in and he continues to vomit and had an incredibly hard time urinating.

This new medication management doc says ok, this isn't going to work, I'm going to put you on methadone because it's cheap and it helps with pain. Methadone... methadone like heroin users have to take sometimes?

Oh yes he said but it's used for pain management as well.

So my poor husband who is nervous to be on the stuff in the first place says ok. 
.doc starts him at 3 pills a day, forgive me I want to say they were 10ng a pill? 

Well then doc ups him to 4. My husband is again doing good, great actually. He still had his days but it was going good until that office closed and he was sent to another doc but that's ok because the new doctor was incredibly kind and compassionate but could see my husband was still in pain.

So now his dose of methadone was at 6 pills a day. This goes on for a few years. While I was of course worried about him being on that much medicine, I loved that he was his old self before the accident. I had him back and everything was going well!

But of course this is reality and not a fantasy, but this wonderful doc decides he's moving. His office will continue to fill his pain meds until he finds a new doctor.

He finds a new doctor but it's going to take about 4 months to see him. Ok not too bad!

About 2 weeks before he was to see new doc, he had something happen and docs at hospital said it was a heart attack.

The day of, I noticed his snoring sounded odd and noticed what looked like a little vomit in his mouth, I go to get it out and he bites me and rolls over. 

I start trying to wake him up, and he just won't wake up. All the while he's snoring. I jump on top of the bed and in him and I slap him and stick my thumb hard into his sternum, nothing just a slight grimace.

I have narcan at home that the pain docs would give him to hold on to for just in case and while I didn't think this was an over dose I used one anyway and... nothing. I call 911 they come in and bag him but also gave him 2 more shots of narcan, they look at each other and load him onto ambulance.


Long story short they said they're almost positive he had a heart attack and possibly a seizure. They also gave him an EEG of his brain which they said his left side is not as fast as right side of brain, so he's seeing a neurologist in June.

I also ended up bringing him to a cardiologist appointment which there looking over charts he says he doesn't think it was heart related. Mind you this doctor knows the meds he was on and told me that wasn't an overdose he also suspects something neurological going on.


So after that craziness he finally sees his new permanent doc.

This doc comes in and sits right down, he doesn't shake our hands, he huffs and plops himself down.

""Mr. Popsicle"" 
"" The ER is saying you had a heart attack.""

We then tell him what the cardiologist said.

""Mhmm"" he opened his folder and squinting and says ""oh man, oh geez, can I be real with you two, can I curse?""

We're thinking this guy is funny so we say of course we're cool with it


And that's when he says "" Fuck! I mean holy shit you're like the 12th person I've seen in two days that's on a narcotic!"" He's shaking his head at us. 


""They keep sending me all these narcotic patients, it's mad you know? Holy crap that's an insane dose of methadone they have you on, that's it gonna fly with me, I'm going to taper you down.""

At this point my husband looks at me in a panic. You should know my husband isn't the best self health advocate so I tell him he's not in methadone because he's an addict, he's disabled and a chronic pain sufferer.

He just looks at me and lightly looks at notes

""I believe you had a spontaneous overdose""

That's exactly what he said. It scared us.

""Yeah I'm definitely going to be tapering you down""

So the whole visit was him telling my husband he's on too high a dose and he's fixing that. Ok that's ok! He should be ok with less medicine.

Well, he tapers him down like this. First week it's 5.1 pills, then the next it's 5 pills a day, then 4 and a half, then 4. 


4 pills a day at what I want to say is the 10mg pill and my husband is getting cold sweats, anxiety and has been crying.

So, he has another appointment to see this doc and my husband wrote down the wrong date and missed the appointment.

This doc then calls my husband and is furious that he missed his appointment and is literally shouting at my husband "" you had a responsibility to see to this appointment and you couldn't do that! You've wasted my time and I'm still tapering you down, maybe even off this medication altogether or you know what? I don't even want to fill your medication you can go to BLANK ON BLANK."" he then hung up on hubby.

We called and looked up the place he said and it's got to do with toxicology.


I'm so incredibly sorry for the long confused ranting.

My husband said he won't know what to do if they take him off the medication, he been on it for years. He's so tired of being looked at as an addict. 

The doc didn't get to see what it can be like for him. To be thrown to the ground with pain from a spasm, to vomit and pass out from pain. He has done EVERYTHING the doctors ever asked of him all with a smile on his face. When he is in pain he is not the same person, he's mean, extremely agitated and will lay there sobbing and I just can't take it.

ATM he's taking 4 tablets a day and he's already showing signs of pain and discomfort, the cold sweats and trouble sleeping.

He told me and I believe him when he said this and looked in my eyes that he can't live this way, if they take away his pain medicine he said he can't go on. And I am SO utterly terrified he's going to seek something from the streets I mean it's every where. I do have sympathy for addicts I do but not everyone in pain is an addict.

I don't know what to do. I guess we wait until this toxicology appointment but I have a feeling they're going to try and shove Suboxone down his throat again and while I understand why they do it, it's not the right medicine for him.

He's already back to walking hunched over, I can not believe the difference taking 2 pills away can do what's going to happen if they take it away completely?

What if he does get so fed up and does something stupid. He's not being dramatic, the X-rays, catscans and MRIs don't lie..


What should he do? Where should he go? I don't want to lose my husband because he can't get legal pain relief in this day and age and what the heck is spontaneous overdose??

Again pls forgive me for my stupid rambling, I'm tired, stressed, worried.

I just want my husband back

AskDocs,Why is it ok to have one surgery but not the other?,"I (38F) have a softball sized mass on my left ovary. It was found on an MRI by OBGYN who then sent me to an oncologist.  I am very overweight and know there are risks but the mass causes pain, bowel issues, bladder issues. (I'm already an introvert but with all the problems it's creating I don't feel like I can go anywhere.) Because I am overweight the Dr says they can't remove the mass (I asked her to just do a total hysterectomy because I have PCOS and an increased chance of uterine cancer.) However, the Dr is pushing HARD for me to have weight-loss surgery. 

Can someone please explain why the weight-loss surgery is ok but not the other?

After surgery, They said they couldn’t go in microscopicly to remove her intestines so they had to cut her open. But when they were finished they said they couldn’t close her back up.

What is wrong with me?? I have an intense desire to be physically hurt or ill. I've been like this for as long as I can remember. I'm happiest when I'm mildly inconvenienced by a temporary injury or illness. I've even hurt myself or tried to make myself sick in a variety of ways.

The only thing telling me maybe it's not Munchausen is that I DON'T want sympathy or attention for it. Attention makes me uncomfortable; I want to be alone. Every time I've been hurt or sick I've hid it from everyone. And it can't be Body Integrity Identity Disorder because I don't want to be permanently disabled or hurt/ill in any significant way, just a little bit in a controlled and temporary manner.

AskDocs,Mystery ENT Issue,"So this is going to be a long post with quite a few different things in it.

31/M 5'8 170lbs

January is when the issues started that I want some feedback on. It's becoming hard for me to know what may genuinely be withdrawal/side effects, and what may be something else.

Starting in January my kids got sick with some type of 24 hour virus, and it went through the whole house including myself. After that i got tinnitus in my left ear and felt AWFUL. Flu-like symptoms, body fatigue, chills, joints popping like crazy. The ear pain felt like my ear was just full of fuild, when I press up below it, my ear would feel like its going to explode. I went to my PCP and he put me on Cipro.  I took it for a weekend and couldn't tolerate it. I thought I would be okay after that, then it was just day after day dizziness/extreme fatigue and a new symptom of head pain near the ear with tinnitus. It was so bad I was calling out of work a few days a week, and I haven't missed work in 5 years. The head pain would be right in front of my ear, in the temple area. Went to ENT after another week of this and was told it was an ear infection, was put on cefdinir for 2 weeks. I took it for a week with no changes so i stopped (yes i know this is very bad) I felt even worse the week following. He put me back on cefdinir for 2 more weeks which I took. Still no changes, and now at this point I can barley drive i was so dizzy. Not spinning dizzy, but almost tilting over dizzy. My eyes couldn't focus on anything and almost felt like they were dancing around. I went to the ER it got so bad after another week, had MRI of my brain, CT of my brain, and CT of my sinuses. The doctor said both showed minor sinus thickening with mucus and a little fluid on my left ear (ear with tinnitus). Nothing wrong or crazy with my brain. was told to take Doxycycline, they thought it was just a sinus infection with vertigo. I took it the whole time ( 2 weeks) and felt a little better but not like before all of this. I went back to local ENT soon after to show the results, and they preformed a Myringotomy on my left ear with no tubs to see if it would help. Long story short, it hurt like hell and didn't help the ringing or dizziness. This point the ENT said he thought it was just TMJ.  I took all of this to my PCP, he doesn't think its TMJ, but thinks something is definitely up but doesn't know what it would be. Took all the blood tests known to man with all negative results. That list of test follows: WBC. RBC, Lyme, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Alpga-Gal, ESR, CRP, RF Qnt, Thyroid, Vitamin. Only thing I thought was worth noting was my WBC was 9.5, CRP was 2, and ESR was 19. I had to go back to ENT to see another doctor because I wanted a second opinion. This new ENT looked over everything, all the scans, blood work, Myringotomy, and months of antibiotics with nothing getting better. He said he also thought it was a mix of TMJ and Eustachian tube dysfunction, then sent me out the door.

So here i am, better then I was in Jan/Feb with all this, able to go to work now.  I'm having to take ibuprofen almost daily, twice a day to get through the day. My head/temple pain has not gotten any better but the extreme fatigue has.  Today my ear has been still bothering me with pain, ringing, and left facial pain from my temples to my tops of my cheek. So i went and bought a ear scope to look at it myself. This is what I took. My right ear which hasn't bothered me the entire time looks what I would say is normal. My left ear which has been the problem ear the whole time doesn't look like the right. I can see the scar were the Myringotomy was preformed around the ear drum itself and a small amount of dried blood, but what I'm more concerned with is all the red and blood vessels I see. When i press on it, its EXACTLY were the pain is in my ear. I will attach pictures and just see what you all think yourself.

AskDocs,Question about meds after Mass discovered in right lung.,"47M  
5 ft 7in  
165.3lbs as of Tuesday  
I smoked for 2 years in the 90s, and vaped for 10 years until Tuesday.  
I rarely drink (once or twice a year, if that)  
Smoked THC-A for pain management, stopped Tuesday, switched to gummies suggested by a friend who's husband is dealing with cancer.

So, on Monday I went to Urgent Care for a chest x-ray after excessive coughing with black tinged mucus, to the point I lost my balance and slid down the wall to sitting.  I recently had to evacuate my house due to high levels of mold, and insect pest waste due to a water heater leak behind the wall.  The x-ray was mostly inconclusive, but possible bronchitis.  Well, on tuesday, the coughing had gotten worse, so I went to the ER, where they did a chest CT with the following impression:

Findings: Spiculated RIGHT upper lobe mass measuring up to 2 cm AP by 2 cm transverse by up to 2.4 cm craniocaudal. Lateral margin of the mass abuts the parietal pleura. Inferior aspect of the mass demonstrates spiculation extending to the minor fissure.

Heart size is normal. Thoracic aorta and pulmonary artery are normal caliber.

Enlarged RIGHT hilar node measuring 15 mm short axis. Enlarged precarinal node measuring 15 mm short axis. Prominent pretracheal node measuring 9 mm short axis.

Visualized portions of the upper abdomen demonstrate no significant abnormality.

  
So, at urgent care, they wrote me a scrip for albuteral, to use every 4-6 hours while awake, and tessalon pearles for cough.

Right now I am coughing up tan colored mucus with obvious streaks of blood (honestly, I have a red/green color blindness, the tan may really be pink), but that was still occuring at the ER when they discharged me.  Is using meds to stop the coughing going to cause issues with the fluid going down into the lung, instead of out?

  
I'm seeing a pulmonologist at the Vanderbilt Lung Institute on Wednesday, unless there's an earlier cancellation, who I assume will order a PET scan (what are they like on the body?  The people I know who've had them arent alive anymore), and refer me to oncology.  But I dont want to do anything to make it worse before then, especially it being the weekend.

She’s very worried so I’m hoping someone can help us out.,"My girlfriend and I are staying in the Cancun resort area and yesterday after an excursion into the Yucatán state to see Chichen Itza and a swim in the hacienda cenote Oxman, she started to develop a rash. We also previously went snorkeling in the reefs on the southern end of Cozumel, but these areas were covered by a wetsuit so l don't think that's likely the source.

She has stated since the beginning that there is no itching, but that it hurts to touch.
Yesterday I was convinced it was allergies, but today the rashes have started to develop blisters and are weeping small amounts of fluid. As the day has progressed, the blisters have increased about 10x in size in the worst area and combined into a single, large blister with several medium blisters surrounding it.

We fly home tomorrow and can seek proper medical attention once we are back in the USA, but can anyone speak to what this might be or how we might treat it in the meantime?

AskDocs,Weird Spot On My Toe is Numb,"Hello! I haven’t posted much on Reddit before so please bear with me. I’m a 28 year old female. I have no known/diagnosed conditions or illnesses. I also am significantly healthy. I lift consistently, watch my diet, get 8 hours of sleep a night etc. 

So a weird thing just started happening and I am getting a little worried. A small portion of my big toe, towards the outside away from my other toes has gone numb. Like no feeling whatsoever. No prickliness, no tingles. Just numb. No discoloration either. 

However it’s just a small portion and I have feeling every where else, it’s so strange.

We’ve been on the SEN route for several months now as my son is late walking and talking. 

We’ve been through mostly every appointment and they’ve all pointed to no additional needs. 

Today we have seen the paediatrician. They also agree no additional needs. But this doesn’t help them in pinpointing the delay in walking. So they have given us a worse case scenario of MD and have referred us to a specialist to rule this out. 

Obviously as a parent, as soon as it was mentioned I spiralled. I’ve since spoken to them and they have confirmed they don’t have a clue what it could be, but that they work from worse case backwards. Is this true? 

They’ve said he’s around 15 months preface for verbal communication and walking. But his cognitive skills are at around 3 years old. 

I obviously googled and became insanely worried with the thought my son may not live past his 20’s.

The thing that is throwing me is he’s become stronger, not weaker. He’s climbing up things, will walk across the room when enticed etc. 

Am I overacting? They have said he’s been referred due to delay walking and talking and his stature, as it’s low. But myself snd mum are only short.

AskDocs,HIV Anxiety & Post-PEP Testing,"Hello,

On December 1, 2023 at around 12:00 PM, I (18M) met up with a guy (24M). He put my penis in his mouth for about ~10 seconds, and I remember he put some of his pre-cum in his mouth and I kissed him after that. Fast forward to December 4, 2024, I went to an emergency room and had my first dose of PEP (Post-Exposure Prophylaxis) ~70 hours post sexual encounter. I continued PEP for 28 days and had my last dose on December 31, 2023.

Here’s my test history:

18 days after PEP (Jan. 19)

HIV AG/AB, 4TH GEN (Blood draw) - Jan 22
- Results came back negative or non-reactive for HIV

HIV AG/AB, 4TH GEN (Blood draw) - Jan 30
- Results came back negative or non-reactive for HIV

45 days after EXPOSURE (After Jan. 15)

HIV AG/AB, 4TH GEN (Blood draw) - Jan 22
- Results came back negative or non-reactive for HIV

HIV AG/AB, 4TH GEN (Blood draw) - Jan 30
- Results came back negative or non-reactive for HIV

90 days after EXPOSURE (After March. 4)

HIV AG/AB, 4TH GEN (Blood draw) - March 5
- Results came back negative or non-reactive for HIV

HIV 1 RNA, QL REAL TIME PCR - March 26
- Results came back negative or non-reactive for HIV

90 days after PEP (April 1)

HIV AG/AB, 4TH GEN (Blood draw) - April 29 (146 days after exposure)
- Results came back negative or non-reactive for HIV

I cannot seem to find a clear answer on when people who took PEP should test. Please keep in mind that my sexual encounter was only oral. My question is: can I consider my most recent test conclusive or do I need to wait until the 6 months post exposure mark?

I would like to apologize for my lack of information regarding this topic & if I rub some people off the wrong way. Please understand that this is very scary & anxiety-inducing experience for me.

63"" approx 200lb
MMJ user (for reducing cptsd hyper reactivity), smoke ~10 cigs/day, non-drinker

I have a doctor's appt next month after about 10 years hiatus (other than prenatal care which obviously wasn't super focused on me) and would like advice on how to talk to the doctor about all this.

The most pressing issue for me is my stomach/digestion problem..

For the last 2 years, a few months after my youngest was born, I sometimes randomly throw up. It used to come on suddenly when I was nursing my baby, but we've been weaned for almost a year now and things have really seemed to just get worse.

There's no nausea or other symptoms. It's just sudden overactive saliva, and I know I've got to get to the toilet within like 30 seconds tops. And I naturally feel like crap afterwards. Because there's no nausea or other symptoms, I don't know when it's ""safe"" to eat and I'll be hungry so I'll try to eat something small and mild, during these episodes any food comes up very quickly afterwards. It is hard to stay hydrated during these episodes bc sometimes water will come immediately back up as well. And at other times, I can chug a glass of very cold water or eat a big bowl of ice cream and be fine.

In the beginning, it wasn't too often. Maybe once a month or two. It would be one or two bouts of vomiting, but sometimes it would last a whole 24ish hours. Followed by a day of recovering, but then a few weeks of being fine.
Since the beginning of this calendar year though, I feel like it's just more frequent and prolonged. I'm having more days vomiting than not I think. My teeth are suffering.

My diet is fairly consistent (dx ADHD but suspect autism as well, though I don't necessarily want that in my record) 

If anything, I've made what I would expect would be positive changes to my diet actually (particularly since the start of the year) I started cutting down on coffee bc I like it very sweet and creamy. Now I don't drink it at all, if I do it's just a small cup for the taste (as opposed to the barrel for the caffeine previously) I've been eating more fruit too bc they're also hydrating. Chicken instead of beef, that kind of thing. 

--------------

I also, but the timeline is different, have had some pretty severe rashes since my firstborn (7y ago, much longer than the stomach issues)
I've broken out in hives randomly throughout my entire life but these rashes are different. The first after giving birth the first time was most severe. It lasted months and spread from my stomach to my legs and arms. I wanted to filet myself. Eventually, a friend's doctor dad put two and two together that I had been taking zantac during pregnancy, stopped after baby was born bc heartburn was cured, and zantac is a type 2 antihistamine. I started taking it again and the rash finally after months finally diminished. (Had previously gotten steroid cream from walk in, did next to nothing) After my second and third babies, I started taking zyrtec at the first sign of itchiness.
Benadryl has never been effective for me (other than making me unabashedly irritable) but when I was younger I was told it was hormones and they were large welt-like hives. These rashes since my firstborn have been smaller, not scaly but dry feeling, and just incredibly itchy. Not burning (have had shingles and can confirm it's not like that) but it does make it hard to focus on anything.
Of course no changes in soaps other than trying to find something even gentler. At this point, I'd love to scrape it all off with pumice stone and start fresh. But sometimes I only use Cetaphil, the most gentle cleanser I could think of.

Again though, the skin issue used to seem a lot less frequent. I have a patch on my arm now that's been there for a few months already. 

---------

FWIW, my mom (64F) also has random hives. No resolution for her yet. She does have an EpiPen and takes Allegra every night to prevent the rashes. She's also a breast cancer survivor.

---------------

So, feel free to give your guesses (I have mine of course) 
But also, is this a good way to explain what's been going on to the doctor next month? Or would chronologically be better?

Not sure if this is pertinent but I've been eating a relatively low carbohydrate diet for a decade or so, to help treat my PCOS symptoms. 

I take metformin and spironolactone for the PCOS, as well as levothyroxine.
Editing to add: I also go for monthly infusions of lidocaine for the pain associated with my crps. For about a year now. 

I had a blood test last year, where my WBC was flagged at 3.3 and my neutrophils at 1.7 
I had a blood test last week, where my WBC was flagged at 3.3 and my neutrophils at 1.5 and in case this is important, my ferritin was also flagged at 14

The only other blood tests I have to compare to were from 2022 and 2021 and everything was in the normal ranges.

Considering my syndromes and medical issues/medications I am on, is this something I should enquire about? I'm currently under the care of a doctor who lives in another province and who I speak to over the phone every 3 months for prescription renewals. He makes it very clear every time we speak that he has too many patients and would like me to find another Dr, and I wish very much that I could, but the waitlist where I live in Canada is at around 8 years. I am quite desperate to keep him as a prescriber, and so I don't want to bother him if this is nothing to worry about.

26 AFAB, chronic ear infections since I was 4. Tubes were put in twice (the first time was done badly). Second time, they came out on their own (properly). (Still in that time frame of very young)

I still get ear infections (once every 3-4 months), though people refuse to diagnose it/give me anything to relieve them. Symptoms - low/muffled hearing, ice-pick pain in right ear, throbbing pain in left ear,  sinus pressure, headaches, sometimes fevers, pounding head.

I've been dismissed so many times, I'm hesitant to pay more money for nothing to come of it. (""It'll go away"", ""I don't see anything"", ""it's just sinus pressure"")

Related issue: every day I'm removing ear wax from my ears (no q-tip, with the back of my thumb so i don't go too far), if i don't, people comment on the ear wax ""dripping"" out of my ear, it gets on my pillow at night (used to sleep on a towel, so it was easy to wash. Now i wash the pillowcase when it gets too bad)

Hearing test performed 2023 (audiologist, same appt as the ENT) - right ear ""off the chart"" (High) of recordable values (a table of values where you can mark the result). Left ear - borderline hearing loss

AskDocs,26M- Had some terrifying symptoms during a flight and I'm worried I may have some larger issues that I've been ignoring.,"I know I've made plenty of bad choices with my care, and the ultimate answer is to see a doctor. I just want some opinions from Medical professionals on here and if I am freaking out too much, or not enough. I'm sure I will make some doctors facepalm hard with some of the things I've been ignoring. This will be a long one.

I'm 26m, overweight, extremely active and unbelievably busy for my business, but also can be sedentary for days straight sitting in cars due to my job. No real health issues recorded and always had surprisingly good blood pressure, levels etc when I was going to the doctor, family has some bad health history. I haven't gone to dr in years, and I just lost health insurance with no way to enroll now until end of the year. It's getting to the point where I am going to just pay out of pocket because I'm not liking how this all looks. Maybe someone can also recommend who to go to so I don't just waste money getting bounced around with referrals. 

My stress levels are, as my last doc put it 2 years ago, ""killing me quickly."" I have zero way to put my life on pause, I have massive investor goals to meet and have been exponentially growing in the last couple of years, not having a free day or a second to shut my brain off. I own Two businesses that occupy 100% of my waking hours. My main business is very high stress and spontaneous; i absolutely love what I do and wouldnt have wanted my life to turn out ANY differently, but....and I certainly am not saying this to brag or for sympathy, but rather being honest with you doctors.. my stress and responsibility are absolutely off the charts for any age of person, and I do genuinely think my stress and lifestyle is actively killing me. I previously didn't think that it was possible to feel stress killing you, but now I get it.

Some symptom background:

For the past few years I'll get this feeling in my heart that feels like I held my breath for a while. That fluttering feeling in my heart, like a ""pressure build up until it flutters away."" Like how if you hold your breath and then release you get that head high feeling and your heart races for a second. I also have had this kind of head pressure behind my nose between my eyes, I'm pretty sure it began when my brother broke it but I never went to get it fixed. I just let it heal. Yes, I know, stupid.
I genuinely eat barely anything but I am very out of shape, that walking for 10 mins will put me out of breath. I can often feel my heart rate when I am doing something, either in my chin/jaw area, or if i was to restmy head in my hands i can feel my head bounce with the pulse from my hands. My heart rate is high. I'm a HEAVY mj smoker and have always had very ""virgin"" lungs that would make me cough easily. I occasionally have wheezing. When I hold in a hit of a blunt I can feel myself start to get that nitrous oxide head high feeling of passing out (I do NOT use, I tried once in High School.) I rarely use Adderall a couple times a year, but I did pass out completely about 2 years ago, when I was smoking and held a hit in too long. I was on an Adderall, and didn't eat all day so chalked it up to that.

I've also had random pins and needles in my hands every so often for years now, but largely when I am sitting for long periods of time so I wasn't ever really concerned. I do also get fluid buildup in my legs from sitting (bad) but it drains when I sleep or am not in the car that day. Lately, I have been feeling like I can't breathe during the night, like it's too stuffy, and I can only go back to sleep if I crack a window wide open or else I feel like I'm slightly suffocating. Friends/family have said I sound like I almost have sleep apnea. 

Fast Forward with all of that out of the way, to the event that's keeping me up. I was on a 3.5h flight (nothing new.) I can't quite put my name on it and itll be very hard to describe, but I just had a ""feeling"" that the ""pressure"" wasn't right. It was very hard to describe. I can't quite remember why, but I recall that it wasn't just me experiencing or sounding like something was off. I just keep remembering that I felt like the cabin wasn't pressured right.

Well, a bit after take off as we climbed I felt my head start to get very pressurized and uncomfortable. I began to feel like I was having a stroke. As you can tell I am not one to go to doctors, but it scared me so much I almost declared to the stewardess that I was having a medical emergency. Finally as we cruised at altitude I became more and more disoriented, had a headache, and just felt like my head was going to explode. Then I began having a nose bleed, and the pressure In my head kept building. I really thought I was going to die. As if the nose bleeding wasn't enough of a physical sign, as we descended altitude, the ""pressure"" began bubbling my saliva out of the sides of my mouth and I knew I was not just imagining things at that point. It did feel like my head pressure was releasing. By the time we landed I felt OK but completely sounded like a stroke victim. My brother who got me from the airport asked me how many Xanax I took, that's how physically f'd up I sounded. I sounded like I had a medical episode. I knew then this could not all be in my head. 

Foaming at the mouth, as you can imagine, yields nothing except search results of ""this is grave and you are dying."" I have been terrified to fly since because I really thought I was going to die, but flying is an absolutely integral part of my business, so after years of symptoms, the flights may be what pushes me to finally fix whatever is happening (yes I know I'm stupid for that.) Between heart flutters, suffocating feelings, what feels like circulation issues, nosebleeds, head pressure and mouth foaming, I am scared to hear what they have to say, but it's time to face the music.

Thanks for reading this far. If anyone has any advice I'd appreciate it.

I’m trying to hydrate by sipping on water or rice water and eat light bland food like hard boiled egg, crackers, rice, applesauce. 

I went to urgent care yesterday, but I was told to take Pepcid. I’m just wondering if that would help? Pepto and mylanta didn’t really help. For context,  I take pantoprazole due to gastritis that I had in December (got en endoscopy last month, I don’t have acid reflux/everything is looking normal) but my belly button area/intestines rumble and I haven’t had a BM since yesterday (it was normal in the morning and had diarrhea after that but nothing since then). 

The rumbling kind of gets to me since I don’t have the urge to go to the restroom and when I try, nothing comes out. Anyways, please be kind. I would really appreciate any suggestions or advice. The nausea really triggers my anxiety/panic attacks as well so I can’t wait for this to pass. I’m also wondering if Tylenol would help?",1cp98w6

Male

6’4” 179lbs

White

Stomach issues becoming apparent over the past month or so. I would describe it as mild to moderately intense pressure, bloating, and pain in my stomach after eating only certain things. Usually lasts approximately 4-6 hours.

It started becoming apparent after eating eggs consistently in the mornings. I was eating scrambled eggs (3x) along with Greek yogurt for breakfast almost every day for probably close to 6 months. About a month ago I started to notice that after id eat breakfast, I'd feel this discomfort for most of the afternoon. I stopped eating the eggs and the discomfort went away. I thought it was exclusive to cooked eggs but now I've had pizza twice this week and have felt that same discomfort. I don't believe the pizza was made with eggs, but not 100% sure I guess. 

Diet wise I am not perfect but not extremely unhealthy either. I am also quite active and go to the gym 4-6 days a week lifting weights and doing cardio. 

My dad has Crohn's disease. I got a colonoscopy at age 21 (29 now) and they didn't find anything concerning at the time. 

I have scheduled a gastroenterologist appointment but want to know if there is anything else I should be doing or considering to try and avoid this discomfort in the meantime as I can't see the doctor for about 3-4 weeks from now. 

Thank you for your help",1cp98hr

AskDocs,Just what exactly is my doctor looking for?,"20F, 206lbs, Light smoker, 5'6, History of repeated (recovered on scene) paracetamol overdose

Originally, I spoke to a doctor about sudden joint pain that appeared 5-6 months ago. Since then, the pain has spread to every part of my body, muscles included. My knucles also redden and my fingers swell. I was originally taking multiple blood tests to monitor inflammation and try to detect viral arthritis, however this was deemed unlikely because of how long the pain has lasted, thus the doctors almost gave up (so did I). I decided to give them one last call and my actual doctor explained that she doubts it is arthiritis at all. She told me I would be taking another blood test to measure my Vitamin D levels. I went for that today, but I just checked my NHS app and saw this comment:

***""1 yellow and 1purple for Bone pro, ESR, Ferritin, HBA1C, U&E, Vit D, CRP, FBC, Folate, LF, Vit B12.""***

All my life since abt 7-8 years old I was very obsessed with sex. I became sexually active at 18 w my bf and then we broke up last March. The next month my sex drive skyrocketed and I was literally doing myself abt 6+ times a day. I got a new sex partner it was so bad. And now it’s like I’ve tried everything crazy. With that sex partner I bled and hurt and every positive feeling possible. I feel like I can’t get off from regular sex now. All day at work im thinking about it. My bf on the other hand has a very low sex drive so it’s actually quite devastating to my well-being but it works, not rlly, but. Either way, I would just like to know what are possible causes for this. I did a DNA test a year ago and it said I’m likely to have high testosterone. It said I have an apple body shape. My voice is a little deep. I can be aggressive. I’ve been in fist fights. But idk ! If that’s the only cause. Just very curious ",1cp4veo

I’m mainly trying to learn more about anti inflammatory products for suffering from HS. 

currently on Epuris to try and treat it but also have been offered cortisol shots whenever they get a flare up. Cortisol shots are $50 a shot and are needed twice a week. Which is almost the same as a month of ozempic.

I’ve done some research that people have found that ozempic has helped with their inflammation for HS. Is there any weight to these “reports”. Also A big contributor to HS is obesity so I could see that being a good “reason” to take ozempic.

Would I be wasting my time reading into ozempic to help with HS? The dermatologist I was recommended is always booked and I’m in between family doctors so I’m doing a lot of research on my own.",1cp8v7n

Discoloration and damage can be seen around shoulders and arms and legs in this photo, as well as original complexion can be seen around my stomach area and upper legs:

https://i.imgur.com/5hdTi83.jpeg

I just got back from a trip to Cancun. I tried to apply SPF 70+ sunscreen as often as possible, but I forgot to reapply a couple times in water and ended up with really bad sunburn and sun poisoning on my face, shoulders, upper chest, arms, and knees. The worst of it seems to have happened while lounging in shallow water wearing only shorts, so my back and mid-torso, and upper legs were submerged and did not get burned, but almost everything else was exposed. The discomfort and pain and itching only lasted a couple days and are all gone, but my skin looks terrible. I've gotten noticably considerably darker, and there is significant dryness and peeling. 

Aside from one occasion when I was a kid and had some minor peeling, I've never experienced anything like this. My main concern now is the rash/bumps on the back of my hands and the darkened skin patches. What can I expect in terms of healing and clearing up, considering my age and the extent of the damage? Are there any treatments or lifestyle changes I can make to clear this up while preventing any further problems? Any advice would be really appreciated.",1cp8nj2
AskDocs,Severe foot/ankle pain for days now. Doesn't seem to fit anything I can research.,"Some background: i'm a 26yo Male who is active but overweight, no recorded major health issues but been having some symptoms (unrelated to foot) that have me wanting to get checked out. My job has me sitting for very long hours, sometimes 24h straight in cars, and I'm currently  on a work trip now. My trips involve no planning and I have to go with the flow which means I'm not always prepared.

I drove a very large amount (30h straight) which is nothing new for me at all, but this time my ankles began to swell up and hurt badly, with pins and needles, and the left one began to hurt excruciatingly. It was the worst pain I've ever felt and I had to literally drag myself from my hotel room to my car, what should have been a 5 second walk took 10 minutes of crying. I rested it as much as possible and put it in cold water (no ice, middle of nowhere, everything closed.) It got slightly better the next day and the day after that seemed 90% healed. Now, I know i messed up but I continued to walk on it because I had a ton of stuff to do, and part of that involved walking a LOT on a gravel lot in AirForce1s. I felt at the time that I was stressing my foot too much and that it hurt on the side but I figured it would be like any other time I got tired feet from walking around, and would go away. The next morning I woke up to even worse pain, but not just in my ankles, but also on the sides of my foot with the outside being extremely painful. 

Fast forward 3 days of rest and putting no weight on it and it hasn't gotten any better, in fact, I can no longer even limp on it. I've tried ice, hot water baths, more advil than I can count, and of course rest, but even resting is hard. The weight of my foot on itself hurts like hell and I can't even lay down comfortably, and the blankets touching my foot HURT. Mainly the pain is on the outside edge of my foot, the inside side of my ankle, and the top of my foot. My toes can't even touch the ground, my foot is permanently ""scrunched up"" and so my shin and calf muscles are extremely tired and the top of my foot kills. It feels like if I tried to stretch my ankle out (like make it flat with my leg) I'd literally pass out. When I walk I can only put weight on the back part of my heel, literally any other part of my foot will have me doubling over in pain. The top of my foot got very swollen to the point where my shoes became tight and as I said I can no longer place my foot flat on the ground like normal, it's scrunched up, picture if you were trying to keep your toes up out of some puddle without actually raising your foot. 

I missed my window to get health insurance after my 26th bday so I really do not want to go to the hospital as there are no urgent cares nearby and I'm 99% sure I'll just be given pain meds and told to rest. I had this happen once prior after stepping the wrong way and it healed after 3 or 4 days of limping but has never been this bad. But I cannot even lay down anymore comfortably and I still have 6 days left on my trip. I cant even walk into stores to get meds or things i need, its that bad. 

Im almost certain that yes, my footware is very wrong because i was tired of hearing about wearing old man shoes. I dont really care anymore and will be getting some new shoes tomorrow if I can even walk in the store. Any other advice? ",1cp8mxt

medical,infected?? or eczema?,"hey all, sorry in advance bc this is pretty gross!! In the past 6 months I have had three pretty nasty flare ups of the eczema on my hands. All three times the general practice doctors I went to told me it was an infection and gave me antibiotics. None of the times did these help, it got so bad the first time (November) that a walk in doctor sent me to the ER with a note marked URGENT bc I needed antibiotics in an IV but when I got there their dermatologist took one look and said nah that's not infected you need steroids. 

so I got Prednisone tablets and that cleared it up. The second flare up, almost the exact same story. By the third I vouched for myself and asked for the Prednisone from the start even when the walk in GP said it was an infection. Yesterday I saw my own doctor and showed her the wounds I was concerned about, and she said it's infected and gave me antibiotics. 🥲😥 I'm stressed out that it's just gonna be the same thing all over again, but then again every ""flare"" presents a little differently so maybe it really is just infected this time???? my arm/elbow is also affected, which has not happened before. 

there are so many unknowns involved here like what's the trigger and why has this suddenly become chronic when it had never happened before November, etc etc, but right now I really just need to know if I should try to get some Prednisone or if antibiotics will actually help this time?? (ps- I'm super anxious about looking like that person who just wants a specific drug, and I don't WANT to be on steroids for any length of time bc I know they're hard on you but it's the only thing that's worked so far) 😭

I also have a handful of steroid creams that are sometimes marginally effective but my doctor told me to not use those while on the antibiotics so I'm just,,, feeling very lost 😭

I'm fully aware this isn't the place for absolute answers but I'm just hoping it can reach someone who has maybe some experience with this and maybe I can feel less confused and alone about the whole thing 🥲🥲

I've had this same thing happen to me 3 times now, like every 2-3 weeks. I get a feeling of something in my eye, like an eyelash. Always my right eye, outer corner. There's never anything in it. Flushing it out with water and eye drops make it WORSE. The only thing that helps is camomile. I'll make tea, soak a cotton pad in it and put it over my eye, usually overnight when I'm trying to sleep. The pain is not the worst and the tea makes it feel a bit better, but it's super annoying and uncomfortable. What's the weirdest to me is that it keeps. Happening. It goes away, then comes back again and stays for 3-4 days. I never had any problems like that with my eyes before.

medical,Do I need to be concerned?,"I wrecked my motorcycle (low-speed, ~10mph) 7 days ago. I was flung over the handlebars and the side of my left hand took the initial impact. I was wearing gloves with some padding on the wrist (bless proper motorcycle gear). I didn't seek medical attention afterwards because I didn't feel all that injured.
Since then my wrist and side of my hand have been a bit sore and the pain gets slightly worse when I move it around. I can move everything fine, even though it's a little stiff and very slightly swollen. 
Yesterday, I rode my motorcycle for the first time since the accident, which exacerbated my hand and wrist 😮‍💨. My hand and wrist were more painful and swollen today, so I started icing it, which has helped with the pain. Now that I was paying more attention, I noticed a slight lump. The lump doesn't feel like it's just swelling, it's feel like bone. I made sure to feel around the lump and compared it to the anatomy on my other hand because I wanted to make sure it was an abnormality. My uneducated intuition tells me I bruised the bone.

medical,My dad is trying to get me to drink hydrogen peroxide. How dangerous is this?,"Lately, every time I get sick, my dad heavily pushes starting a hydrogen peroxide “toxin flush”. I am always incredibly skeptical of any “remedy” or “miracle cure”, so I always do my own research. I look for peer reviewed articles with sources cited and written/compiled by real doctors and scientists. I have a general grasp on biology and chemistry, but I’d be foolish to presume I know enough about the topic to completely debunk it. I can’t find any legitimate looking information about it other than doctors consistently warning people NOT to consume it.

 It’s difficult to argue with someone who thinks that they know everything about the subject, and you yourself have no strong rebuttals because you KNOW you’re not a biologist/scientist. He “wins” just by being more confident about what he is preaching. 

My dad is a pretty smart guy, but he’s not educated. Says his blood oxygen content is higher than ever and that’s why he never gets sick. He insists he has TONS of research and there’s even “many many books about the subject”. 

Has my dad drunk the koolaide or is there any scientific backing AT ALL that there are benefits of orally consuming peroxide?? How does peroxide negatively/positively affect the human body? 

EDIT: I WAS NEVER GONNA DRINK IT. I know it’s foolish. I’m just trying to figure out where this is coming from??

So his “solution” is food grade hydrogen peroxide diluted with water. I don’t know the water to H202 ratio. ",1co49jd
medical,Comment on: My dad is trying to get me to drink hydrogen peroxide. How dangerous is this?,"Yeah, it doesn't matter where he got the suggestion. It doesn't matter if he is smart. I don't understand your position that you don't have any rebuttal  and that he wins simply because he is confident. He isn't a doctor and you know that. That's all the rebuttle you need. I also don't get the point where you go against your own research where you state you can't find any legitimate information about it. 

Evidence-based medicine means there needs to be evidence based on clinical trials showing efficacy in treating a problem. It isn't simply about writing a book and imagining theories as to why it should work. 

You fail to realize that the burden of proof is on the person advocating anything to show proof and not on you to debunk it. One needs to see a study showing a person having a specific problem that was aided by hydrogen peroxide. It isn't enough, and far from scientific proof much less medical proof, that hydrogen peroxide should be taken when one is ""sick"". You won't find any clinical study pertaining to finding people who are sick and giving them hydrogen peroxide. That just defies logic. 

Do not take anything he says seriously about medicine. Seek professional medical help if you have concerns. No need to get into arguments with him about it. Just move on when he makes suggestions.",l3dru8q

medical,MCAS obesity help,"MCAS weight loss. I want to share this story for others who might struggle with MCAS without knowing. And perhaps some tips or tricks from someone who lost weight while having a medical condition.

After a lifetime of medical problems I have been diagnosed with MCAS. [Mast Cell Activation Syndrome, it is a sort of allergy which creates inflammation throughout the body] Which was a relief because almost all the issues I had were caused by it. I have been treated with H1 and H2 and vitamin C. I never knew I had allergy like reactions because most docters dont know about MCAS. I have had excema and rashes, astma (but not really), sleep apnea, water retention, obesity, dry skin, infections etc etc. 

Before the diagnosis I thought my obesity was causing these problems. I used to have all the before mentioned symptons but after treatment I lost all the before mentioned issues except one, obesity.

I used to be a fat kid including all the above mentioned issues. I was eating healthy and working out but nothing helped me reduce my weight. After around my 18th or 19th birthday all these symptons dissapeared. My obesity vanished and suddenly I was ripped with the same eating and training pattern. 

After years of being healthy and absolutely loving working out i got covid19. Which now I know can activate MCAS. All my childhood symptoms reappeared. I gained weight quickly. No matter how much i work out and eat healthy, it was just like my youth. 

After going on reddit and reading a lot about working out i started noticing stories of people who had medical conditions. I had seen multiple docters, endocrinologists and health experts as well as a training and food coach. I was on mysimba which helped reduce weight but i didnt know why and it seemed as a quick fix for a real medical problem. I learned about MCAS and had to beg my doctor to get me tested. In the meantime I regained all my weight in mere weeks because i stopped using mysimba. Turns out I was right and I do have MCAS.

After treatment my doctor convinced me that my weight will drop if I work out and eat healthy. But that hasnt happened. All the other problems dissapeared in mere weeks and obesity remains a problem. It could be that chronic infflamation takes a lot of time to dissapear. But it doesnt sit right with me.

For people struggling with weight, read about MCAS if my story seems familiar to your case. Since people on reddit knew I had MCAS and the doctors didnt im hoping for your endless wisdom again. I wanted to know if someone has had the same experience or has valuable knowledge that might be helpfull. Or some tips and tricks would be nice. Especially regarding the medical part. Im a male, 183cm and 116kg. I think i genuienly know how to train as my friends all have succes with my training schedules and i used to have succes before covid too.

I don’t really have particularly many trials, just the Ph1 has an extremely frustrating/demanding sponsor. The PI is quite anxious as it’s his first big trial so he won’t push back on their incessant requests for everything under the sun by EOB. 

Also recently found out I’m having a sponsor audit (high recruiting site) so there’s that added looming pressure now too.

I do love all the knowledge and experience I’ve gained over my 2 years but might be time to move to start-up/regulatory and work from home. Anyone been in a similar scenario?",1copa5v

I have done this exact job before so I'm not inexperienced but they asked for a sample of my previous work. I told them that I do not have samples because the reports are confidential and are highly regulated. They countered that I can type up a report to highlight my writing skills but they asked that I use a journal article as a source material. 

Okay fine, I started to do that but I grew angry and frustrated that I'm having to spend unpaid time to prove my 5 years of documentation experience. In a regulated documentation role, I usually have access to templates, style guides, SME collaboration, and document history so what would a sample report prove? That I can read and write? They aren't requiring a Master's degree or a PhD so it is not a SME position, it's a documentation position. My gut is telling me that this is not the type of company I want to work for.

clinicalresearch,Jobs with a B.S. in Neuroscience?,"Hi y'all 

I graduated with a bachelors degree in neuroscience two years ago in 2022. after that I managed a coffee shop for a year. I was too burnt out to find a job in my field directly after graduating and rlly enjoyed being a barista.

but then I got a job in my field as a research assistant in a biomedical research lab at the university I graduated from. I worked there for 9 months and since I worked as a temporary employee there was a limit on my hours. somehow I went over that limit, and now I can't work there and a lot of other bullshit ensued after that. my boss did fight for me to stay but the fucking university has bullshit rules and there was nothing more she could do :(

so now I'm sad and abruptly have no full time work going on at the moment. I still work at the coffee shop part time luckily. but I worked really hard for and at that job, and truly enjoyed it so it sucks. 

anyways, I've applied to most of the research assistant jobs in my area, but I don't know where else to apply. I'm really doing my research on the places I apply to, and making sure it correlates with my research interests. I want to get my masters but that wouldn't start until fall of 2025 and I want to stay in my area but the research I truly want to go into (psychedelic research/assisted therapy) isn't very prevalent here. 

other than the clinical route, are there other types of jobs people with neuroscience degrees are qualified for? there's so many scams out there and not a lot of actual listings unless you directly go to websites. I dont know where to even start sometimes. remote jobs would be cool too.

What devices would give us advantage, what infrastructure would be more convenient. How many nurses are usually needed in bigger sites?

clinicalresearch,Comment on: How will outsourcing affect the quality of research?,"The first mass offshore move of DM and to some degree biostats programming happened in 2004 (Quintiles leading the pack - retained the leads in the west with all support and programming going East). Over the next few years the trend spread to the other big CROs. Big Pharma mostly appreciated the cost cutting while mid and small don’t trust the quality, driving *some* biometrics business to the next CRO tier. Quality in India slowly improved over the next decade, but then two things happened: 1. Labor costs in India were rising making the savings not as substantial and 2. Even big pharma started asking for NAm/EU biometrics again. Big CRO slowly started growing their Western biometrics staff again. Now the pendulum is swinging East again. The quality out of India is generally pretty good now BUT the higher attrition rates and timezone differences can and do cause some delays and communication problems. Give it 5 years or so and the pendulum will likely swing West again, but by then, the industry won’t have trained up the staff to meet the need, so people will be harder to find.

To answer your question, in spite of people loving to say it will be a disaster, the truth is it’ll be “meh”. The research results will be no different… and it’ll introduce one more possible delay risk that mixes in with a million other delay risks that all together are the reasons 85% of clinical trials run late to their original timelines (that’s a whole discussion unto itself that I’ll leave alone).

All that said, I do recommend getting out of DM. This from someone who started there (1999-2004) and then moved into full service project management… to feasibility… to running PMOs…. To being VP of ClinOps. Getting out of DM was one of my pivotal career decisions.",l3gzg88

medicine,"How you address concerns about feelings of ""low blood sugar"" in healthy people without diabetes who don't actually have low glucose?","I'm not sure how common this is for the rest of you, but sometimes people who are otherwise healthy, without diabetes, tell me that they feel lightheaded/dizzy/weak due to ""low blood sugar"" when they have not eaten for a while.

They don't actually have low glucose levels.

medicine,How to spot a victim of abuse?,"Hi, I am a PCP in Russia. Sometimes, I encounter patients (mostly women) who come to an appointment accompanied by their husbands, brothers, or other friends or relatives (mostly men). There have been instances where I suspect that a person might be experiencing abuse. For example, they are not the ones speaking during their appointments, they do not maintain eye contact, they have bruises or marks in odd places where one doesn't usually get bruised, and so on. I politely ask the person accompanying them to leave so that I can speak with the patients in private. However, this approach almost never works (and when it does, the patients deny abuse, so I actually have never been in a situation where I had to call the police or other special service). More often, the accompanying person becomes angry, takes the patient, and leaves, leaving me feeling hopeless and sad. I am unsure if they are experiencing abuse, but the fact that I do not know how to address the situation is driving me nuts. I often get the feeling that if abuse is happening, I might even trigger something to make it worse (by suspecting something and the patient might take the fall for it).

It doesn't help that I wasn't taught about it in med school and also in 2017 Russia decriminalized domestic violence in cases where it does not cause ""substantial bodily harm,"" such as broken bones or a concussion, and does not occur more than once a year (so yeah, abused victims who are married to their abuser will not get much help from the government, which is f*cking bullshit, I know).

I am here to ask for resources to educate myself on identifying victims of abuse and and ways to carefully ask a potentional victim about it. I know the US and European countries are much more progressive in this regard. Perhaps you have a special approach for patients where they can safely share this kind of information with you/ask for help. I would also like to know if the signs I've been noticing are correct and if there are any other signs I should be cautious about. I have read that some clinics have two markers in the bathroom - they use a red marker to label the urine sample if they are in danger and a black marker if they are not. However, in my hospital, patients do not sign their samples. Nevertheless, I guess the confrontation with an angry relative or friend would be unavoidable.

medicine,For all you PCPs ,"***Practice Management Question***

Hi 👋🏻 I am a physiatrist working at a VA hospital in a unique situation where my department is its own entity and we have an inpatient unit where we (generally) have planned admissions that are mix between acute rehab, subacute rehab, respite and wound care. We also have an outpatient clinic that is generally outpatient spinal cord injury and musculoskeletal focused. We also have a PCP who works exclusively outpatient. 

The PCP has pushed the attending physiatrists to directly admit patients from clinic for work up and/or stabilization of acute medical conditions like altered mental status, fever of unknown origin, acute pancreatitis, hypoxemia etc without evaluation or stability in the emergency department first. The PCP will not be following the patients during their inpatient admission. 

As physiatrists with minimal training in hospitalist medicine we have been uncomfortable with these requests as management of rehabilitative, not medical issues, is our training. 

My group is trying to generate a process map for when outpatient clinic patients should be sent to the ED for evaluation. 

My question is > when do you all send your own outpatients to the ED for further workup AND do you have any literature to support this?

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXubd3QTHcw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXubd3QTHcw) (nearly identical, but video, shows the woman today, includes video of the incident)

Essentially, during May 2020, a nurse at an oncology infusion center collapsed.  Her coworkers *did* call 911, but they did not properly assess her, perform CPR, give her oxygen, retrieve the defibrillator.

Obviously the bit about starting CPR when they couldn't get a blood pressure is not correct, but they should have assessed for a pulse.

One nurse (her supervisor) filmed the whole event, instead of giving aid.  Doctors present did not help either.  One doctor said in trial that he ""was not qualified"" to give CPR.  When one of her friends she worked with showed up, that woman started CPR.

The nurse is now quadriplegic and need total care around the clock.

I think the workman's comp claim is a bit sketch too. Technically, heart attacks *can* fall under workman's comp in some situations, but this sounds like a sudden cardiac arrhythmia, and so it would be unlikely that workplace stress was a contributing factor I would think.

But ..... it's terrifying that she collapsed in a medical facility and no one followed basic BLS for 7 minutes until there was someone who arrived that insisted they do something.

The nurse recording the incident is disgusting, IMO.  I feel like that should be grounds for losing your nursing license, the gross indifference to someone dying in front of you is incompatible with being a nurse (or a doctor for that matter).  The fact that a doctor claimed he was not qualified to give CPR should at least have a license suspension.  If he's not qualified to give CPR, he shouldn't be qualified to give any sort of care.

Having a coworker collapse would be a nightmare to me, not just because it's a coworker, but because they're all adults.  But even in the NICU, we're required to be BLS certified and expected to perform CPR if needed on adults, morally and ethically, if not legally.

Are *you* prepared if one of your coworkers collapse?

Edited to add:  after reading some comments, if your hospital has ever directed you to not perform BLS on someone without a pulse for whatever justification, I would suggest you report that to your compliance hotline.  I do *not* think that directive would hold up under scrutiny.  ",1clehxs

Just for fun, if you want to.","I'm doing a writing exercise (not homework, just cause) and had an idea of explaining vampirism and zombies through an interconnected patho, with classic features of these two fantasy tropes coming from hysterical exaggerations of the disease process by the public. I'm just an ED nurse and school was a long time ago so I thought I'd ask here, just in case someone was interested in the idea. I'm not looking for something that's 100% possible, just meh, so it reads plausibly.

I have a rough idea with some holes:

A fluid-borne plague causing a hypermetabolism, and rapid healing (how? GH?). Too rapid in most cases, causing emaciation, an acute need for calories, rapid and disordered wound healing and tumorous growths, often in the brain. Bone growth often stops in children, causing frail bones and often proving deadly (chest expansion for resp).

Driving physiology maybe something like:

* Hyperthyroid somehow
* and pituitary tumor

Initial symptoms:

* Emaciated
* Red eyes
* Light sensitive skin and eyes
* Twitching
* Sweating
* Twitching
* Sustained high fevers
* Seizures

Many die of anoxic brain injuries. Those who survive have often sustained brain injuries, leaving them unable to speak or process. Those who are not vegetative use what facilities they have to satisfy the hypermetabolic hunger. Growth hormone increase causes rapid wound healing. Combined with brittle bones, they often are broken and knit at inhuman angles, while cuts and injuries heal too quickly developing into encapsulated lumps, abscesses or cancers. Those who can meet the increased calorie needs long enough develop some gigantism symptoms on top of the rest. This is self limiting with fragile bones and eventually they become collapsed crawlers. Often die when rib cages collapse and unable to breathe, like peds. 

Lastly, a very select few, who win the lottery of no brain injury and develop no cancers, can recover. 

Recovered plague patients remain somewhat hypermetabolic, calorie need remains higher than before, heal somewhat faster, bone density returns over some years, teeth elongate slightly (or gums somewhat retracted?), photophobia persists. Pale and gaunt, grey pallor, clammy. High protein and carb needs, a scary desperate appetite could be inflated to rumors like your classic vampire.

Or is it not permanent but for many years after as things return to baseline? Even that is enough for vampire rumors. Does fast healing remain? Or just the rumor?

Is there a way to explain them being long-lived? Or able to “hybernate” or go dormant like tardigrades? For the immortality rumors?

""Rapid healing"" still sounds very vague and baseless...

Physician in a hospital-employed ID group. We had a meeting yesterday and I’m struggling to cope with the news. Our department was told to see nearly double the outpatients this year. This information was presented in a confusing way so most of my colleagues didn’t grasp it but after doing the math it’s roughly 12,000 more patients.

I think we are being tricked and many slots are going to be added in a stepwise fashion slowly. Mind you, ID doesn’t make a lot of money but inpatient is where the meat and interesting cases are. None of us enjoy outpatient and being in a large tertiary system, we get filtered chronic fatigue and delusions of parasitosis that local docs refuse but we aren’t allowed to refuse anything.

I am a heme/onc attending in a small-ish community private practice and we collaborate with a small community hospital down the street. We have, as a practice, struggled with how long it takes for us to work up our patients. Because it’s a community practice, any hint of cancer comes our way and we work it up. We then order the CT’s, the PETs, the biopsies, MRIs..etc. This process has taken too long, ~ 3wks. It then takes about another week to 10 days to book a chemo chair. We have talked about this before with radiology and the proceduralists and we basically settled that there isn’t much that can be done and that if you need a more expedited work up then you admit the patient. I don’t like it. It’s a work in progress. 

The quandary comes, as you may have surmised, when I was referred an employee. Very nice guy, career hospital employee, jumped around a few departments. New diagnosis. I ordered the work up. Everything was booked and done in 3 days. Not an exaggeration. 72 hrs. Path came back a week later so I was able to fit him in for a visit a couple days after that. We talked about chemo, consents signed. Treatment booked another 2 days later. So a process that usually take 4-5 weeks, took about 11 days. 

Don’t get me wrong, I get the “we take care of our own mentality.” This is someone who has put in a lot of work in the hospital, helping people. So we need to take care of him. But this isn’t giving him extra meat at the deli, or giving an extra discount on tires. He cut in line in front of people that equally need an expedited work up.

The Kansas City twins were born on Easter Sunday and were diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) shortly thereafter. Their life expectancy is <2 years without treatment with onasemnogene abeparvovec (Zolgensma), a one time gene therapy infusion which delivers a normal copy of the SMN1 gene to the lower motor neurons. Their insurance company, Mosaic Life Care, removed coverage on this medication one day after the twins were born and has denied family appeals for coverage.

Below is a copy of the statement made by their CEO:

*“Global pharmaceutical companies are putting profitability over affordability, making it impossible for employers like our hospital system to bear the financial burden of these exorbitant drug prices.*

*In January 2024, Mosaic’s Health Care Trustees made the gut-wrenching decision not to cover expensive gene therapy used to treat ultra-rare diseases. Covering these treatments could cripple the financial viability of our health system, directly impacting our more than 4,000 employees and the approximately 270,000 people who rely on the health care we provide in small communities across four states.*

*We are working hard to help find alternative solutions and financial resources to help in this case.

You should know how expensive clinical trials and drug development are. Each drug costs a minimum of 2-3 billion dollars to bring to market. NIH funding only reaches the hundreds of thousands of dollars level max.

Edit: [correction link](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/s/mMQE6FDOUc) it seems the NIH funded about 10% of gene therapy trials so that’s more than I expected. Of course those links also state that most of those were phase 2 trials while the much more expensive phase 3 trials were funded entirely by NIH or academia but still. The overall contribution of the NIH almost certainly extends to the millions range",l2b55jf
medicine,"Comment on: Newborn twins fight SMA, family says it’ll cost $4.2 million to save their lives as insurance cut coverage of Zolgensma one day after they were born.","COGS on many cell and gene therapies can range from ~30-60%, clinical trials typically cost as much or more than early development/ research, then you take into account the fact that many of these therapies are treating rare diseases where the number of eligible patients a year can be from 10's to 100's the price tags start to make a little more sense. 

For example it's estimated there are between 10,000-25,000 babies and adults in the US with SMA, and that is considered one of the more common rare diseases. Then of that group the only ones eligible to take Zolgensma are babies 2 years old or younger *and* that have bi allelic mutations in the SMN1 gene. That pool of eligible patients shrinks fast. 

There needs to be a financial solution to covering these drugs until production costs come down. BlueBird Bio has multiple CGTs and pulled out of the EU market completely because reimbursement in Europe is negotiated with the governments directly and they couldn't come to an agreement on costs. That was not a decision of 'oh, we will have 20% margins instead of 40%', it was that they cannot manufacture these therapies and sustain being in business. 

If we want to continue to develop these products that have the ability to cure disease rather than treat, in a single dose, there needs to be a way for industry to be incentivized to do so. Theoretically it would be more profitable for them to make a drug that you had to take your entire life to treat a disease than a cure.",l2bbic7
medicine,"Comment on: Newborn twins fight SMA, family says it’ll cost $4.2 million to save their lives as insurance cut coverage of Zolgensma one day after they were born.","To your first point, the purpose of the study wasn’t just to look at Zolgensma but to look at targeted gene therapy as a whole. Also clinical trials are funded years in advance, you can’t fund them at a whim when investors come in so the bias you mentioned doesn’t work. All the trials that were analyzed were likely funded years before the drug came to market. 

To your second point, they received funds from charities but not the NIH. That article states that there are 1300 projects that received a total of 450 million in NIH grants for spinal muscular atrophy as a whole, which includes research into diagnosing it, pathophysiology, gene targets and dozens of more topics other than this drug. There’s no evidence to suggest significant NIH funds were used for this drug. 

This is the problem with the NIH. No matter how much funding it provides, it will always be a drop in a bucket compared to what’s needed.

medicine,I have serious concerns about my supervisor's competence,"This is half a rant because I can't tell anyone I know but also because I'm becoming concerned about my supervisors' patients' safety. I'm at an academic family medicine clinic, so the residents my supervisor oversees change every few months. I am so tired of cleaning up after his messes and misses. He is making a ton of money from his practice and is arrogant to boot, so I don't have any empathy for him. Just some cases that have left me shocked:

1) 70 year old woman with new anemia. Ferritin is low. No obvious explanation. One resident starts this patient on iron without any work up. Another resident advises her to just continue the iron when her hemoglobin improves minimally. My supervisor oversees all of this and does not change anything about the plan. I finally see her maybe 6 months later the anemia was initially discovered and realize she's never had any scoping, so I've referred her urgently.

2) My supervisor insists on monitoring not only TSH, but also T3 and T4 for hypothyroid patients. Even with this, I am routinely discovering patients whose TSH is 7-10, symptomatic, and never addressed so I have to clean up the mess.

3) My supervisor insists on docusate for constipation. Not as bad as the others but it is emblematic of his arrogance because he's been told multiple times by pharmacists that there is no evidence for docusate. He never backs down. His response? ""Big pharma no longer makes money on docusate, so of course they released a study that it doesn't work!"" And then he still prescribes docusate for his constipated patients.

4) I couldn't remember how to test for Cushing so I ask him. He says ACTH and cortisol in the morning. I look it up because I know he's often wrong; indeed, guidelines specifically state that cortisol should only be tested with dexamethasone suppression test the night prior. I bring it up to him and he says that's too hard and not something we do. I do it anyway because my patient really looks like a case of Cushing.

5) A patient had a partial hysterectomy 20 years ago. The gynecologist specifically wrote in the discharge note that she should have paps every 3-5 years moving forward. I see this patient and she hasn't had a pap since the partial hysterectomy 20 years ago because my supervisor had told her (and documented) that paps are no longer necessary for her.

6) Patient is on lyrica 150 mg twice daily. Nurse tells my supervisor that there's a nonserious side effect and the patient wants to try a lower dose. My supervisor just stops it cold turkey and the patient goes into horrible withdrawal. When it's discovered a week later what happened, he blames the nurse for her poor communication regarding the lyrica (the nurse's communication was clear).

The above are some of the worst I've seen and are just from the past month. It's so frustrating to work with someone so bad and yet so self-assured.",1cixiwn

medicine,Disheartened medical student in the public healthcare system of a developing country,"I'm a final year medical student in a developing country. I study at a medical school affiliated with a large public hospital (with a capacity of >2k beds) in a major city. Despite that, the hospital system is extremely overburdened. Our country is densely populated and public hospitals are legally obliged to admit and treat every single patient that turns up. We cannot refer a patient elsewhere even if our beds are all occupied. I often see 2-3 patients in one bed in the wards. The outpatient department is overrun with more patients than the doctors can see, and I see senior residents shouting at the junior ones to go through the patients quicker (for example, to not measure everyone's blood pressure etc). Doctors barely get to spend a minute or two with individual patients. 

I want to be clear that even though we are stretched for resources in terms of being understaffed, there is absolutely no dearth of material resources. In this regard, we are lucky, because public hospitals in small towns and peripheral areas suffer from a lack of the most basic resources- gloves, gauze, syringes etc. 

There is no shortage of any basic medical equipment here, and the government provides us an unlimited supply for free. No patient is ever to pay for any medicine or treatment availed at the hospital. Only for a few medicines and procedures that cannot be performed at the hospital do patients visit a private pharmacy or an alternate hospital where they might have to pay out of their pocket. 

Much of the work here is performed by first year post-graduate residents and interns (who also do all the scut work that the supporting staff ideally should have done). Senior residents supervise and consultants are not frequently around.

I understand the limitations of our system, and in some ways my distress is assuaged knowing I may be able to help the underprivileged masses by studying and working here during my internship year. 

In terms of ability to treat a disease, the doctors here are excellent. They are some of the brightest people of our country, most of them have worked extremely hard to get here and they've had so much practice in our high-volume setup that they really know what they're doing. However, I'm extremely disheartened by the inhumane way our patients are treated in the system. 

I have seen invasive procedures such as lumbar punctures (once with >10 failed attempts), and thoracocentesis performed without any local anesthetic. Predictably, the patients howl in pain. Many a times, aseptic precautions are not followed AT ALL. We've seen nurses and doctors picking up intravenous catheters (bare needles) from the grimy floor and using them on the patients. The local site is not sterilised with alcohol before a tap. 

The post operative patients in the surgical wards are often in a lot of pain. Sometimes, more than twenty medical students are present inside a single operation theatre at once. We bring our own scrubs and slippers, which means that there is effectively no guarantee of asepsis around the area. 

The labour rooms are the worst. No one treats their patients as badly as the OBGYNs. Every member of the staff, from the doctors to the nurses and attendants shout and scream at the mothers for every little thing. Mothers are routinely scolded for having too many children, and showing up at the hospital for the fifth time with another kid on the way.

An epidural or any other anesthesia is never offered during normal vaginal deliveries. The mothers are alone in the labour room and no attendants are allowed. Non-emergency episiotomies are performed without local anesthesia. I've witnessed resident doctors stitching up large vaginal tears without anesthesia. The women are strongly rebuked for crying in pain. 

I do not understand why the doctors behave the way they do. We do have the resources to administer anesthesia and to maintain sterility. Like I mentioned earlier, we are very well equipped compared to public hospitals in the rest of the country. The only explanation I can come up with is that the doctors are brutally over-worked and have stopped caring altogether. During intern year, shifts lasting 30+ hours are not uncommon. We hear from our seniors that our postgraduate residents practically live in the hospital. They only get to sleep for about 4 hours about every other day. They are allowed no weekends or public holidays off work. It's work 7 days a week and 365 days a year. 

I've lost much of my motivation to become a doctor after witnessing such distressing scenes. I'm anxious about going to the hospital, even though I must every day. I feel hopeless, because I know that in a year, I will be an intern at this same hospital and might be expected to treat patients the same way. 

There is no way to escape witnessing what I see every day. I've resolved to treat my patients humanely when I come to it, but I'm afraid that I will turn into a inhumane, cruel doctor when I've been in such a stressful and toxic environment for too long.

medicine,Imaging prior to referral,"ETA:  You have all convince me, not that I need to order the imaging, but that in these two patients who walked in with 'I need to see a neurosurgeon' as their chief complaint - I am going to go back to the beginning and send them to PT.



A local neurosurgical practice has refused to see pts unless they come with prior imaging.  I understand that the surgeons time is limited, but it is shoving the burden of prior auth onto the PCP.  As primary care, there are areas of medicine I am more proficient at than others. Spinal pathology is NOT a strong suit for me and I have enough of my own 🤬to do.

Is this happening to other folks?

How are you handling it?

I think the surgeons should use a mid-level for this and see the pt - order the films and then they can see the surgeon.  This is what a different practice in the area does.  (Big area - can't change everyone to second practice, but am switching those I can.)",1chl1ao

My treatment onc. talks about it but said she doesn't participate in the prescribing of the end-of-life cocktail and my symptom/pain/palliative oncologist told me in a meeting yesterday that she is the medical director for my hospital's EOLOA program.

So when I looked at MyChart I saw that she had documented my request for Death With Dignity if and when the time comes and that is good.

Nevertheless I feel like I am being stonewalled when they say: ""you have to be given a prognosis of  six months or less and you aren't there yet""

This shuts down the conversation and they move on to something else.

The point is that many patients don't want to wait until the last minute to discuss it and the people I have spoken to about it (cancer patients' loved ones etc) and actual cancer patients who are exploring the same possible option all say that to leave it until the last moment is not good as one can become to sick and too incapacitated to jump through the hoops and get all of the red tape out of the way so that the way ahead is free of complications when they decide to exit this life (if they do choose to use this option).

The only other way a patient can avoid waiting for doctors to agree on things is to voluntarily stop eating and drinking and go into hospice when the time is right (if there is ever a 'right' time).

My mom (75) went into the ER five days ago for severe abdominal pain, and they found masses in her rectum, then more masses in her abdomen: ovaries, uterus, lymph nodes, maybe something on her kidneys. (lungs, liver, and brain are clear). They told her it was cancer, and from there, information coming from her started getting...spotty

We were able to see her pathology report from her sigmoidoscopy and the final results stated: ""high grade carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation"" - the only thing she officially told us was that she had Neuroendocrine Cancer. 

When we asked about her treatment options, she has told us so many different things, from ""it might only be palliative care"" to ""actually we are going to do chemo/radiation NEXT MONTH"" 

My brothers and I feel strongly that she might be purposely keeping us in the dark about her prognosis. We can understand her desire to shield us from bad news, but we're also struggling with not knowing. She says she just wants to go home and have everyone treat her like normal and ""not do anything special."" When we've tried to ask about life expectancy, she has said she doesn't want to talk about it with us. When we've pointedly asked if this chemo would be palliative or curative, she has said she doesn't know. 

We desperately want to take her lead, and do whatever she wants us to. But at the same time, we are all feeling like ""if she was told she has a few months left, we want to know""

There's also the very real possibility that she's NOT hiding anything from us, but that she's been so overwhelmed with information that she's in shock/denial and just wants to get home. We've been begging her to let us be in the doctor appointments, and she's been saying ""yes definitely"" but then she keeps having the appointments without us.

cancer,Rant - Red tape is literally killing my dad ,"So my dad had marble size bump appear at his temple about 2 months ago. The ER would not/could not needle biopsy so sent him back to his PCP who sent him to a dermatologist who refused to biopsy who sent him to a plastic surgeon who refused to biopsy who sent him to an ENT who did the biopsy which came back neuroendocrine carcinoma of the salivary glands. (At this point the tumor is the size of a crescent roll.) The ENT rushed him into a PET scan because that kind of tumor is usually secondary to something else. Important to note: the ENT sees no sign of nerve damage from the tumor, and the PET scan shows no futher metastes anywhere in his body.

Turns out to be the primary tumor, so ENT does urgent referrals to a surgical oncologist, radiation oncologist and medical oncologist for treatment.  The radiation oncologist gets him right in but can't do anything until the surgery to resect the tumor happens. While in this office, the oncologist measures the tumor again, and it is 3 cm larger than it was 10 days earlier during the PET scan. The radiologist sees the beginnings of nerve damage from the tumor.

The university hospital refuses to allow us to schedule an initial consult with the surgical oncologist until the referral is fully processed by the insurance company (not have the appointment, mind you - just schedule it for a reasonable number of days out). The insurance company takes 5 business days to approve a referral marked urgent, and the university referral department takes another 3 days to process the authorization/referral and clear us to make an appointment. Which brings us to this morning: 

I call the scheduling office, to find out that they can get us in EIGHT WEEKS FROM NOW. For an urgent referral on a fast-growing tumor that is just starting to cause nerve damage. By the time we have this consult, the tumor, which is now the size of a croissant, is going to be I cannot imagine how large and will pretty much definitely have caused nerve damage which will make the surgery harder, the recovery longer, and my dad's quality of life worse for the rest of his life. I feel like ""the system"" is just doing it's darndest to see if we can drag our feet until he's Stage 4. 

His insurance is very narrow - it will only cover doctors in one hospital system, so we can't pick up and go elsewhere. 

TL/DR: my dad has a fast-growing cancer that is still salvageable if we act quickly, but he's trapped in the reality of our convoluted medical bureaucracy, lowering his chances of survival each and every day. 

Rant over. 

but i'll totally take advice if anyone has any.

cancer,I'm feeling gulity.,"I went through stage one cancer back in April of 2021. At the time I got diagnosed, 2 other family members did. My great uncle and one of my older cousins. My uncle passed that December and my cousin is still fighting. We just got news that both my grandmother and another cousin has been diagnosed in the last week.

I feel gulity. I didn't have chemo or radiation, just surgery. It feels like a fraud to say I had cancer when looking at their experiences and coming experiences.",1co3nc4
cancer,Opinion on Ethos Adaptive therapy for recurring pancreatic cancer for 71 year old,"Hello, my aunt had pancreatic cancer in 2016. The tumor was localized and was surgically removed. Chemo and radiation therapy were done post-surgery with lower dosages. She is 71 years old now and during a routine PET, a tumor was detected, which was confirmed to be cancerous with a biopsy. The tumor is again near the operated region, but the doctor said that surgery would be risky, because of the age factor and the proximity of the tumor to other organs. The doctor is suggesting 25 days of radiation therapy along with chemo (5 days a week of radiation + 1 day in a week of chemo). Now, for the radiation, we were told 3 options, one of which is the Adaptive therapy using [Ethos from Varian](https://www.varian.com/products/adaptive-therapy/ethos). We were told that it's precise, has a lower radiation effect, etc.

With a significant cost difference, I wanted to know if adaptive therapy is indeed useful or is it hyped. Anyone here had/heard of this therapy? Thanks.",1cosffc
cancer,BEP chemo- Will I be infertile? ,"I 22f was recently diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and had surgery which removed a 12cm teratoma and my right ovary. The doctors are recommending 3 rounds of BEP. I’m currently seeing a fertility specialist to freeze my eggs before chemo begins, but so far it’s not looking good. They were only able to locate 3 follicles which means at most I’ll produce 3 eggs from this cycle. I want to do another cycle to hopefully get some more eggs, but I’m worried that waiting that extra month will allow my cancer to spread further. Ladies who have had BEP before, what are your experiences with fertility? I’m really worried that I will be left permanently infertile after all this. Any advice would be much appreciated, I’ve been severely freaking out over this. ",1cohq83

It started as three tumours in her stomach, and has spread to one of her lungs.
Before the PET scan, the doctors told us that it's treatable, and that mom would be alright. 
But now she's not.  She's going to get chemo, but it'sto delay the inevitable.
I don't know how to cope with this. We don't know how long she's got left. Probably a few years, as all the tumours are in early stages. 
But still. I'm eightteen, and I'm going to lose my mom before I probably turn thirty. My little brother is almost fifteen, and he's going to lose her, too. 
Does anyone have advice on how I can come to terms with this? ",1co4xnp
cancer,Mom giving up treatment - what comes next?,"My mom is 82 years old, she was diagnosed with muscle invasive bladder cancer in January 2023 with spread to lymph nodes, hip bones and lungs. Through surgery on her bladder tumor, then immunotherapy, then chemotherapy she was able to get it down to just a trace left in her lymph nodes as of her last scan in March. 

The immunotherapy was ok, she was just tired a lot, but when it stopped working and the cancer started spreading again last November, she switched to chemotherapy. Her oncologist really didn’t want her to go the chemotherapy route because my mom is 82 years old and the oncologist thought it would be too hard on her.  

Well she decided to do it anyway, at first it was just a rash but then her vision started to go bad, nauseous, constant headaches, exhausted, neuropathy, lost taste, cold hands and legs, lost her hair, etc. The great news is that it was working and her last scan showed her almost clear, her oncologist said she had to keep going with the chemo though so she’s been suffering through it. The last straw was that for the last 3 weeks she was losing the ability to properly swallow food. This past week she said enough is enough and I’m done with chemo, I don’t care if the cancer comes back, I’m not doing this anymore.

Keep in mind my mom is 82. I respect her decision, she’s lived a long life and even if this means this is her last year with us I want it to be fulfilling for her for as long as it can be. 

I know everyone’s cancer journey is different and if there is still cancer that will now grow as she is stopping treatment, I was wondering for those of you who have been in this position what did the next 3-6 months look like for you? I’m not looking for medical advice but I’m trying not to be afraid and be strong for my mom. It would help me not be so afraid if I could hear other people’s stories. ",1coclhn

The will to work out is here, but the energy and strength is not. My doc told me to take it slow. Whenever i hit the gym for a 45 minute workout, I’m exhausted for days.

Because of my energy level and the need to nourish my body well, i have to accept my body as it is, as long as i can’t change it.

cancer,Sudden stage 1A diagnosis post-op (likely immediate remission): how to handle?,"The imposter syndrome is strong with this one. If there is more suitable subs, please send me there!

I had surgery ten days ago to remove a large tumor (massive! volume of 5 liters / 1,3 gallons) along with the ovary it grew from. Laparotomy, vertical incision with 15 cm / 5.9 inch. What send me to the ER was painful constipation with no other symptoms, had ultrasound done, my tumor was operated on undiagnosed, I was given about a 60-65 % chance that it would be benign.

Spoiler alert: it wasn't. I was at my post-op check-up yesterday and the pathology reports had indicated cancer. Stage 1 grade A dysgerminoma. Apparently, that means surgery and then you're done.
However, as is standard apparently (I'm in Germany), they send all samples to a second lab. Also, I have a CT scheduled to check for metastasis. If both of these come back clear, I'm good (70-80% chance of that). If either indicate something other than stage 1A or show metastasis, it's chemo / radiation and the whole nine yards.

I'm still processing and don't know how to handle this. The uncertainty and waiting is certainly a problem. The bigger one is the suddenness. Even if everything is gone now with surgery, then I still /was/ a cancer patient. I would be a survivor without having knowingly fought any war. I was told there was a war fought and that I had most likely survived it all in the span of two minutes.
All the social implications (urgh, the pity! the worry!!), the life-long higher risk of other cancers, the regular check-ups, etc. now suddenly apply to me without me having had time to process even being sick. Does that make sense?

It is like someone randomly approaching me on the street telling me I've won a marathon and can now carry that medal around, I will have life-long sore muscles and brittle bones from it, and there might be a chance I did actually break a leg (testing needs to be done, please stand by) - but I didn't even know I was running the race.

Am I not focused on the right things? My doctors seemed surprised I wasn't crying or distraught. I think it was shock - but what was my reaction supposed to be like, especially to the first, better scenario?

cancer,Boyfriend refusing standard of care,"Firstly, i know its not about me but the patient but as a caregiver i am struggling.

My boyfriend got diagnosed with colon cancer stage 3 so operable and treatable. We flew to his home country to tell his family who insisted he stay there. We have a rental proerty in the UK and i have been left covering his share of the rent which i can't really afford. He suggested i give up the property but said he was not coming back to clear the house or his stuff.

The past 2 months i have been in his home country he has refused standard treatment which is surgery. His mum found an unqualified herbalist who said that she can cure him of cancer. He is refusing to speak with the gastro who did the colonoscopy and biopsy. He then decided to fast on water for a month based on this herbalists recommendations. He was then violently sick for over a week on her ''chemo'' teas.

At that point he was weak terribly thin and i called an ambulance who said his blood pressure was low and heart rate very low he refused to be hospitalised so they suggested electroyltes and to sip. During this time i have found an intergrative clinic who have pescribed a cocktail of medications but have made no promises regarding shrinkage and have told him if in 3 weeks it grows he must have surgery.

i have no rights to stay longer than 90 days in 180 day period in his country because we are not married. My views that he should take surgery have fallen on deaf ears and i am banned from his mothers house so i have paid for airbnbs for 2 months whilst covering the rent in the uk and paying for private scans and intergrative clinic for him

i am becoming resentful of him because he is being selfish and ungrateful. i watched my brother pass when he was 24 and my friend passed from bowel cancer at 28 because they caught it too late. im having nightmares. im in a country where i cant speak the language and he is more sick because of his 'alternative treatment ideas' he is even looking for venom online rather than just following the treatment at the clinic.  - he said 'it is not sufficient enough'

the herbalist as told him that he is partly sick due to us living in sin for 6 years because we are not married. She told him i am too western and not good for him in this moment.

My mum has urged me to leave him to it because he is not listening to anyone. All the professionals in his home country and the UK told him it will spread and cause a blockage. She told me to concentrate on my own health (i have a health condition) and to start my plans for Australia. We were both awarded permanent residency. She said i must live my life.

My head is in a spin. i have tried to support him emotionally physically mentally by being by his side. - what should i do?",1cmxrcr

cancer,Port question: should I be worried?,"Hello! I've had my chemo port just below my right collarbone for around 3.5 years and it's given me no problems so far. I had it flushed around three weeks ago and everything was fine. However, two weeks ago, I carried home a large box that weighed maybe 5kg (I know I shouldn't have). Due to the weird shape of the box I think I may have pulled something, as the area around my port ached intermittently all day. It was just a small niggling ache, nothing big, and went away the next day, and everything seemed fine appearance-wise, I don't have a fever or anything, so I figured it shouldn't be a problem.

Except now whenever I carry something mildly heavy (say 3kg ish), I can feel the presence of the port for a while after that. There's no pain, it's just that I can feel it there, while I didn't use to feel it this much (this may be my mind playing tricks on me too, I acknowledge that). It still seems perfectly normal appearance-wise, doesn't hurt, and in dance class I was able to do all the moves just fine, it's just that it felt more present than before.

I know that getting it checked will probably give me peace of mind, but I also don't want to waste the time of the medical personnel just because I tend to be paranoid (it's hard to not be paranoid when you have cancer, right?), they must be very busy. I know I can get overly anxious and there is no one I know in my life who has a cancer port, so I've come here to ask: is this normal? Should I worry? Or am I just overthinking?

My thoughts are that considering it’s not in my bones, hasn’t spread from what we can see on the scans and is basically encapsulated. I don’t see the issue with doing surgery before and no chemo other than the small chance that it may come back. I’m struggling with due to the fact I’ve just recently gotten engaged as of dec ‘23 and I’m abt to have my first child in September.

cancer,What if... Anxious post - am I being crazy?,"In January 2023 I went to the ER with abdominal pain that was getting worse and lots of urination frequency and urgency. 

They did a CT scan, and an internal and external ultrasound. Nothing. They sent me home because they didn't know what to do with me and couldn't find anything wrong with me. Meanwhile I was still in pain!

Well I kept pressing the issue for a year and in January 2024 a tiny malignant tumor was found in my bladder during a cystoscopy to look for Interstitial Cystitis in my bladder. It was removed in full during the biopsy and results showed it was not aggressive or likely to spread. 

It's been 4 months since it was removed and my symptoms have not improved since the biopsy. I have urination frequency and urgency and I still have bladder pain. I've been seeing a pelvic floor physiotherapist. 

I went to the ER end of April, dying of pain in my bladder and kidneys. A slight infection was found. The pain seemed disproportionate to the cause. CT scan revealed nothing and I was given antibiotics and sent home. 

I can't shake the feeling I have another tumor but it's too small to see on the latest CT scan. Maybe the tumor isn't even in my bladder? Maybe it's somewhere else? I'm getting a cystoscopy in a couple weeks to check if the bladder tumor is growing back.

Is it crazy to ask for a colonoscopy or some other 'scopy? What if there's another tiny tumor that's pressing on my bladder from another organ nearby and the latest CT scan didn't see it just like before? 

I had zero risk factors for the bladder cancer. It was on nobody's radar. The urologist was not even looking for cancer during the first cystoscopy, he just happened to find it thankfully.

diabetes,2023 Community feedback loop results,"Hi members of r/diabetes 👋

**TL;DR**
We got some feedback from the community. Overall responses were positive but we also have some points where we can improve.
**/TL;DR**

A while ago, we joined the Reddit Feedback Loop initiative in an attempt to learn more about what you think about the community and our moderation of it. For this, Reddit selected a bunch of people who’ve visited the community or have done so in the past and invited them to fill out a survey.

The pool of invited participants was very varied and included daily participants as well as lurkers, and even users who had previously been banned.

Questions ranged from rating the community on a scale from “very dissatisfied” - “very satisfied” to open-ended questions where the participant could provide detailed feedback about their experience here. Of course, Reddit anonymized all the responses and removed harassing content before sending it our way.

I’m happy to report that Reddit has had to remove not a single response for being harmful or harassing <3.

In this post, I’d like to present some positive stats, some points where we could improve, and respond to a few specific answers.

## Positive stats 

Let’s start off with some statistics that we’re happy with!

- 79% of respondents are satisfied with our community. 
- 69% of respondents agree that our community helps them fulfil their needs.
- 85% of respondents agree that the rules are clear and easy to understand.
- 79% of respondents trust that we make decisions that benefit the community.
- 91% of respondents feel that people generally behave appropriately.
- Nobody reported that they feel unsafe in our community.

## Points of improvement

- Many of the respondents report seeing a lot of medical questions.
- Some respondents think the posts are messy and could do with some additional filtering.
- 7% of respondents report seeing harmful content more than once per week.

## Specific responses

I’d like to specifically respond to several concerns or remarks we got.

###Too much mixing of type 1 and type 2 (and similar concerns)

I’m sorry you feel that the distinction between type 1 and type 2 is unclear. We’ve made efforts to clear this up by letting people select their own flair and also adding flairs to posts. However, some of the respondents say that they want us to pick a type and only allow that here.

We will not exclude any diabetic from this community. There already exist type-specific subreddits which are great places for such discussions. We believe that the shared experience of diabetes also deserves a place.

###I still see a lot of posts that break the “No asking for a diagnosis” rule

Unfortunately, many people who are anxious about their health don’t take the time to read our rules before posting. We try to remove these posts as soon as we see them, and have recently expanded the moderation team to help with this.

The best way to help us deal with rule-breaking posts is always using the report button. This makes a post show up in our moderation tools so we can quickly respond.

###We need more moderators

We’ve recently added two new moderators to the team and now have better coverage in different timezones. Hopefully this has already addressed the issue.

###The theme could be polished

Please [message us](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/diabetes) if you want to help out.

###Please get rid of political content

⚠️opinion alert⚠️ there shouldn’t be a need to discuss diabetes-related politics because diabetes care shouldn’t be a political subject. 

Unfortunately, politics can have large effects on diabetes care. I can recall a (somewhat) recent example [about the $35 insulin bill](https://reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/wjvt6e/mega_thread_35_insulin_bill/). This was the first time we had to deal with such a large political discussion in our subreddit and honestly I don’t think we handled it very well.

However, simply banning all political discussions doesn’t help promote a fair and honest discussion of very important topics. Some people use Reddit to get their news, and something this important shouldn’t be hidden.

In the future, I believe that we should continue to allow political discussions so long as everyone remains civil. We’re not here to moderate what people believe or how they vote, only how they talk to others.

### Please add a “Vent” or “Rant” tag so I can filter it out

I can’t believe we hadn’t thought of this before. I’ve added the tag now :)

There were a lot of requests for very specific flairs. If you believe that we’re missing an important flair, please let us know in the comments here or by [messaging the moderators](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/diabetes).

### Please moderate people blaming type two’s for their condition better

It sucks that people still believe that T2’s have done this to themselves. It’s against the rules of our community and we remove any such posts. 
If you see someone who does blame anyone for their condition, please report the post so that we can remove it.

## That's it!

That's it for our response :) If you brought something up in the survey that I didn't mention, please know that we did look through the responses!

Early April all of that caught up with me.  Been on a very conscious diet since I almost lost my foot due to a severe infection.  I have been taking Lantus and Novalog (struggled in the past with shots, been very religious with my regimen since I left the hospital April 11 after a 6 day stay).

First time today since my first diagnosis that I can remember ever being below 100 (wearing a libre 3 for the last week).  I am at this moment sitting at 85 for my sugars and have been below 100 for more than 3 hours.

Huge milestone and just wanted to share.",1cozaot
diabetes,I'm so proud of myself.,"I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes on February 8th of this year with an A1C of 11.7 and a weight of 415lbs. I was terrified. I avoided going to the doctors for SO long because I had a feeling it was bad and I was embarrassed of how I looked and felt.

I immediately got my shit together, got a CGM (Libre 3) and was started on Mounjaro. I went low carb and high protein, and started incorporating exercise into my routine. 

Today I went in for my quarterly checkup, and left with an A1C of 6.2 and a weight of 355lbs. I'm so proud of myself for dropping my A1C 5.5 points, and losing 60lbs, in three months.

   My Dr was so excited, I heard him and the nurse talking about A1C outside of my room, and then I hear my Dr shout ""6.0!"". He rushed to my room afterwards and shook my hand telling me how proud he was. We had our follow up, and as he was leaving I heard him say ""6.0, wow!"" with a smile.

diabetes,Walking / dropping #s,"I'm new to all this and still figuring things out. I tested my blood sugar before taking a walk with my kiddo and it was 140. After the walk (about 40 minutes but not very far, I walk slow and we moseyed a bit), this was my reading and I was sweating, shaky etc. I'd had a snack before going (but not immediately before) so I thought I'd be good but I guess not. I had a banana when I got back (prob too many carbs but I just needed something in me) and now I'm at 112.

I guess I'm just surprised my blood sugar is this drastically affected by walking, especially slow not intense walking. (I'm on metformin and ozempic, no insulin, type 2)

So I just wondered... Do you all snack before or during your walks? I'm afraid of getting too low if I keep walking as a regular habit, which is my goal. Right now my exercise is only sporadic but I'm trying to change that.

diabetes,Faulty batch of Freestyle Libre 2 sensors- one broke in my arm today ,"Hello everyone, 

I have been using the freestyle libre sensor 2 with my phone since Covid times. Before that I just did fingerpicks. I’d say I’m quite used to using and applying the sensors. 

On my prescription I can only have two at a time. I picked my sensors up a couple of days ago from the pharmacy on my repeat prescription. 

My sensor ran out yesterday morning, so I replaced it with a new sensor. Nothing unusual and it worked for a couple of hours fine. Then blood started leaking out. I didn’t think anything of it as sometimes occasionally there are errors that can’t be helped. 

I applied the new sensor this morning and the whole applicator broke as the sensor was fired out and the needle bit was left broken in my arm!!! I have never had anything like this happen. It didn’t actually hurt that bad but I had to go to the doctors to have it removed by a nurse. 

I rang my GP surgery and they said it wasn’t a GP problem and to call 111. But despite the broken bit of plastic and metal remaining in my arm I was more worried about not having another sensor to use. My GP put the phone down on me and told me ‘my line was bad’ but she just wanted me to call 111. 

I filled out the Abbot online form for the two sensors that failed, and the online 111 form to get an emergency prescription. My diabetes team also said they did not have any sensors to give out and they could not help me. 

After having the metal and plastic removed and my arm bandaged I went to the pharmacy to collect my emergency sensor. I explained to them what happened to me and they said a few other people had similar experiences over the last couple of days. 

I used the room they have to apply my new emergency sensor, and guess what, the same thing happened. I ended up having to go back to the doctors and have my other arm bandaged. 

I’ve contacted Abbott on the phone and I asked if there is anything that can be done about raising awareness as it seems they have a faulty batch or there is an error with the applicators. He said he’d pass on my feedback but he doubted a whole batch would be faulty. 

I just can’t believe this happened twice. 
I wondered if anyone else has had the same experience recently?

me: but it's in my family, and my diet was REAL bad...

her (shrug) : we don't know. Maybe you got a virus. Maybe (ton of other possibilities). Just your pancreas, for whatever reason, stopped producing insulin properly (she used very scientific terms i forget atm) and you didnt do it.It just happened, and we're not sure why.

I recently started testing for the first time and purchased a OneTouch Verio Reflect along with the Delica Plus lancing device and the strips/lancets. I had a lot of trouble with the lancing device.

Finally, I was able to test. OneTouch showed 100 and then 96 while Livingo showed 83. This was when I first woke up. I guess I’m wondering if anyone here has experience with both of these meters and which one is likely to be more accurate. My insurance covers unlimited strips, lancets and everything else for the Livingo while I have a $35 copay for 100 OneTouch strips so I’m a tad worried that Livingo may be not as good since it’s free.

diabetes,"Triggering* Homeless, lost health coverage, recent diagnosis, broke college student, etc ","I'm a 20-year-old college student who is currently homeless and in need of legitimate resources to help me get back on my feet. Around March of this year, I underwent my yearly checkup, and my blood work revealed that my blood sugar level was at 458. My doctor advised me to go to the ER in the medical district of Houston, Texas. After undergoing further blood work, it was discovered that my blood sugar level was in the 600s and that I was deficient in potassium and several other minerals. I was taken to two hospitals and eventually ended up in the ICU for four days to correct multiple issues. I had five IV drips and two needles in both arms, and my blood was drawn every 30 minutes because it was acidic.



While I was in the hospital, I lost my insurance (My Healthy Texas Women's Medicaid) within two days, and I applied for Texas Gold Card insurance but haven't received any response yet. Prior to being diagnosed with diabetes, I had contracted COVID-19 in 2022 and had been experiencing health problems for some time, despite having regular checkups that appeared normal to the doctors. I had been expressing my concerns about my health for years to no avail, except for my big cousin, who is a healthcare worker and noticed my symptoms several months ago.



During Thanksgiving, I cut off half of my finger and fainted. I was experiencing symptoms such as frequent urination, fizzy urine, fainting, excessive sleep, dry mouth, bruised feet/legs, fruity breath, cravings for sweets/carbs, confusion, brain fog, saying random things, leg cramps/numbness, sleep paralysis, blackouts, and feeling tired, hot, hungry, and thirsty. On top of all this, I'm also dealing with stress and depression due to my home life. Whenever I try to improve my life, it seems to get worse.



Right now, my main priority is to get health insurance as soon as possible, along with the necessary resources and medication. I need to see an endocrinologist in Austin, Texas, and get a CGM device to monitor my blood sugar levels, which can be too high or too low at times. I haven't worked before, so I need to get a checkup and a device in order to go back to school or start working.

My doctor started me on metformin a little over a month ago. I feel like a new person on it! All my symptoms are gone and my blood sugar is under great control now. However, whenever I eat eggs I get bad stomach cramps and diarrhea. It starts anywhere from 1-4hrs after eating them and lasts for an hour or two then it’s done. No other symptoms. I’ve had no other GI issues with metformin. I began noticing it seemed to only happen when I have eggs for breakfast. I didn’t eat them for a week and had no issues but this morning I had them for breakfast to see if anything would happen and sure enough. 3hrs after breakfast the stomach pain began and I was in the bathroom multiple times. Then it’s just gone like in the past. 

Has anyone else had this issue with eggs or any other food with metformin? Given how well the medication is working so far I’ll likely just not eat eggs but I have chickens so it’s a bummer.

I had my first dose of Copaxone today and I’ve felt fine in all honesty, my body has been achy and a mild headache but not the flu feeling most people get thankfully.

However one thing, the leg I injected into has been stiff as a board and hurting like hell. I found it hard to walk on for a few hours after injecting (4:00pm and it’s just stopped now at 9:30pm).

Any advice for that one ? Did anyone else have this ? I don’t think I did anything wrong as the MS nurse showed me how to inject etc but for the life of me I can’t figure out why my leg hurt so much and it wasn’t the injection as i barely felt that

MultipleSclerosis,Kesimpta Loading Dose Schedule Adjustment?,"Hey everybody. I'm a recently diagnosed guy who just started my Kesimpta loading doses last Saturday at 9 pm. The first dose wasn't too bad, but did kick my ass for a few hours the next morning. I am scheduled to do my second dose tomorrow, but with it being Mothers Day on Sunday I've got stuff going on then. So I am curious if others have either adjusted the time of day they did the shot, so keep it to the same day but maybe take it in the morning instead? Not sure how precise it needs to be. If it wouldn't screw things up too badly I'd be up for just taking it this (Friday) night at 9 pm, but that would be a full 24 hours early.

So others who have taken Kesimpta but had to work around events, what did you do? Most of the info was on taking doses a day late, but not sure if 12-24 hours earlier would be okay, especially for loading doses. I'm pinging my doctor as well just to see if they have any feedback, but being that it is Friday afternoon, I'm not sure they will get back to me this late in the day. Thanks!",1coxv0f

MultipleSclerosis,I'm so so scared of body twitching?,"Hi everyone,
I was diagnosed with MS in 2021, first symptom was optic neuritis. 

Lately I've been going through a stressful period. I've had to remove a suspicious mole (which I'm waiting for the results) and I also did the Pap test at the gynecologist so I'm waiting for those results as well. 

Some weeks ago, when I found the suspicious mole, I became worried and my right foot started to twitch. Didn't think much of it and attributed it to the stress. I also had a big trip coming and that was causing me anxiety. 

However, a couple of weeks have passed and since then my right eye also started twitching. I called one of my doctors and she said it could be low magnesium and didn't think it was MS related. I started taking magnesium but didn't get better. I googled and now I am terrified I might have als.

This week I started having twitches in other parts of the body, like my other foot, the back of my thighs, my hand. The more I twitch, the more I fixate on it and the more worried I get. I'm trying to contact my neuro but I think she's not at the hospital right now, probably just next wednesday.

MultipleSclerosis,Is this an MS symptom?,"Man, this F'ing disease..... I have never been the most self aware when it comes to my body, and I sometimes deal with an MS symptom for quite a while before I notice it consciously. After my diagnosis there were a million moments where I realized that something I was feeling was not only not normal, but part of this disease. To this day I am unsure about weird stuff that happened or I experienced looooong before I found out that I had MS. For example, when I was 18 I remember having this weird feeling in my eyes... like they were stiff or something. I found myself stretching (is that the word?) my eye muscles constantly for a while. One day my mom asked me if I was taking drugs. I kept looking as far to one side or the other (just my eyeballs)and kinda straining to turn my eyes as far in either direction as I could, kinda like when you stretch you legs or something. Did I describe that correctly? IDK. Now that I am 43, I think about that and some other things and I wonder. 

Anywaaaaay, the last couple of days it has been mostly overcast here in Austin, TX, but yet still fairly bright out during the day. A few times I have gone outside the house or from the store and everything feels painfully bright. It feels like instead of my pupils going small to let in less light, they go in reverse as if I am in total darkness. It feels like when someone turns a bright flashlight on you in the middle of the night. I have found myself having to squint so my eyes are barely open just to move around, and yet it is still painful. I haven't had a mirror handy to see if my eyes are dilated, but that's the feeling I get. Next time I'm gonna try to take a selfie or something to see my eyes, but again, it is painful and I end up just having to stop and close my eyes for a while. I definitely felt like a weirdo this afternoon standing in the parking lot of the grocery store with my eyes clamped shut for 15 minutes. I couldn't even make it across the lot to sit in my car, so I stood in the hot sun melting until my eyes decided to adjust.

Am I making any sense? I don't know if this is or could be MS. Anyone ever experience something like this? Or is this some other fun thing I have going on?

TLDR: anyone have light sensitivity when transitioning from inside to outside? Could that be MS?",1co9da9
MultipleSclerosis,Tecfidera & others,"Hi guys,

I am considering of starting Tecfidera again. I have been several years without a treatment because I have been quite unlucky with level of liver enzymes - included Zeposia.

I was on Tecfidera for a while (1 year) before covid, and it went well - except for the horrible flushing that brought me to stop the treatment (it became embarrassing during meetings and presentation).
My question is: what can I do to avoid flushing? Also, at what time do you take the pills? Could I take them in strathegic hours to avoid flushing at work?


Lastly, what other treatments I could consider with not effects on liver enzymes? ""Light"" treatments for RR.
Kesimpta? What are the side effects?


I am really struggling of finding the right treatment. I got the diagnosis 10 years ago, and only one attack (sensory alterations) despite the uncovered long periods of treatment. I am getting worried as recently I am feeling those sensory alterations again - same points - after a tough week of biking everyday uphill.

MultipleSclerosis,baseline MRI,"Hey everyone,

I was diagnosed in january but had my MRIs in october where inactive lesions were found in both my spine and my brain. I started ocrevus in February. 

However, I just went in and did my “baseline” mri, where they found 4 new inactive lesions in my brain. This freaked me out because I haven’t really had any symptoms from my onset optic neuritis… 

My doctor said that it’s more than likely i developed the lesions in the 5 month period before i started ocrevus, but should i be worried that my dmt isn’t effective? does this likely mean i will have to switch? i get my second dose in august and my doctor wants to take another MRI then…

I don’t really know what im asking here. i feel like i was just starting to process that I have MS and i was very thankful that im not feeling any crazy symptoms, but these new lesions really freaked me out and im just scared about progression. is there anything i should be doing or should know?

MultipleSclerosis,Cannabis for spasms?,"I was diagnosed 12 years ago. 2 years ago it started attacking my legs and never stopped. Or slowed down for that matter. I have spasms that are so violent I can’t stand up. Not twitches. Full blown seizures of the legs that are so violent it scares anyone that sees it. The dr. prescribed me baclofen 10mg 3x a day. The first day it was like a dream drug. No spasms. At all. Then…it was like a fuse blew. I felt really drugged. Couldn’t talk right. Sounded very intoxicated. And i started feeling a pain that had kind of subsided. So I stopped taking it. Today is the 4th day without and I’m finally starting to feel better. The first two days without I could only sleep because I felt so bad. This was from one pill one day. Two pills the second day. I never made it to the 3 I was supposed to take. 
I would rather have spasms than pain. 
My body…my choice. 
I also prefer cannabis. It does not make me feel drugged, it doesn’t make me so I can’t communicate, and it def doesn’t bring more pain to me. 
I took a lot of solvent less rosin last night and it actually helped with the spasms and I slept all night. Does anyone else have experience treating MS or spasms with cannabis? What more could I try? Any help would be so much appreciated. I can’t take anything that makes me a zombie like baclofen did. ",1co2z83

MultipleSclerosis,My Gratitude Journal story about cleaning the sink! ,"My Gratitude Journal story about cleaning the sink! 

First, S/O to my FB groups for the alcohol tip. Cleaning was much easier. 

The Gratitude story is I did it, from the wheelchair, by myself. The sink was littered with cannabis resin. It looked horrible and made the entire bathroom look nasty. I was always worried about messing up my clothes or phone because there was nowhere to place anything. 

Now, I got the whole sink again. This makes brushing my teeth a standing activity again. That's good for fresh breath and standing over the sink can be an MS exercise. 

My wife sees it as an Act of Service, her #1 love language. That'll score me some points which I always need. 

The smell of cannabis is lessened in the bathroom. That's more for HER. *fist bump* 

Finally, this is about me. I proved to myself that I'm capable of reaching the counters and cleaning. *Superman pose* Learning a few new angles gives me a little independence that I'm applying to kitchen counters. (I HATE having to ask for so much help reaching food, silverware, and drinks. 🤜🏾🤛🏾♿️)

The sensation seems to amp up anytime I put pressure on my feet and it leads to an uneasy/unsteady feeling while on my feet.

I don't feel like I've received much information from my Neuro about what is going on and how to proceed.  

This is my first exacerbation since being diagnosed 10 years ago.  I'm not really sure what to expect.  How long the Solu Medrol helps to resolve symptoms and if going back on a DMT will help clear some of the symptoms as well?  

I'm scheduled to leave for a 5 day camping and hiking trip in 2 weeks.  If I don't go, I'm out a significant chunk of money.....I'll get over it.  I really want to go but I just don't know if it's wise.  I would be hiking 5/6 miles a day with up to 1500 ft in elevation.  Temps will be anywhere in the 60's to 80's during the day.  The terrain will be rocky.   Of course I'm hoping that this will resolve before I leave, but if it doesn't, has anyone had success on a  trip like this while experiencing similar symptoms?

MultipleSclerosis,Internuclear ophthalmoplegia,"So, I have been seeing double for years. It’s mostly when I look to the side. My mom (who also has MS) has/had strabismus, where one eye turns inward, and it got worse and worse until she had surgery to correct it. My eye drs have been saying mine is the same, which makes sense because it’s often hereditary. I’ve been wearing a prism in my glasses, to turn my eyes outward. I’ve been doing that about eight years, though I noticed the inability to focus when my eyes are turned at least four years before that. 

So yesterday I had an ophthalmologist visit to ask about that same surgery. I ended up with the double-vision specialist, which was really lucky because it turns out it’s not strabismus at all! She said my answers were leading her to believe that it was brain related, and because I have Kaiser, she pulled up my last MRI and was like yup, this tracks. It’s called Internuclear ophthalmoplegia, and it’s caused by a lesion on the medial longitudinal fasciculus, which controls the eyes. So when I turn my eyes to the right, my right eye looks at what I want to look at but my left doesn’t turn enough, and same the other way. 

The good part is I don’t need surgery. The bad part is because it can’t be fixed. But she said it was unlikely to get worse, and equally unlikely to get better (even though the internet says it often resolves). Idk, this is just fascinating to me, I had no idea this was a thing. ",1cnw9ys

[Which is best generic over brand-named prescription medication?](https://www.epilepsy.com/stories/summary-antiepileptic-drugs)

Comment from r/epilepsy user:

· Insurance companies push for generic over brand, so you need a special prescription note from the neurologist if you need the brand as there is a different chemical structure with a brand vs. generic (i.e. Keppra).

· Drug interactions are also a problem, especially for those of us who are on three or more meds, or very high mg doses. I found out the hard way that there's one antibiotic that interferes w/ my meds (can't remember the name, starts with M), and that I absolutely will get sick off of a strong muscle relaxant like Valium, even in a microdose. This site has become very helpful to me: [https://www.drugs.com/drug\_interactions.html](https://www.drugs.com/drug_interactions.html)

· In an ideal world, your GP, neurologist, and pharmacist would be double-checking all this for you, but even if you've got the best, accidents happen. Hope this helps

**Epilepsy, disability designation, and work**

(mostly from retroman73)

In the USA, epilepsy is recognized as a disability. If you are already working and an employee, and also diagnosed, your employer can ask certain questions or ask for evidence, but it is limited. Generally, they can only ask to the extent it might impact your job performance.

The EEOC has a good page on this in sections 5, 6, 7, and 12.

[https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/epilepsy-workplace-and-ada](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/epilepsy-workplace-and-ada)

**Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and (Social Security Disability Income) SSDI (USA)**

(mostly from retroman73)

Applying for Social Security Disability Income (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is a long wait. Over a year is common. Don't be surprised if you are denied at least once. Just keep appealing, pay attention to deadlines, and be sure you are working with a lawyer who \*specializes in disability law\*. It is critical to winning your case. Most of them will take your case with no fee unless and until you win. They take a chunk of the proceeds that build up while your case is under review or in an appeal, but it's worth it.

\- My understanding is that you should apply for SSDI and SSI (even if you only qualify for one), BUT ask the lawyer about your case. Just as medical questions are best for a doctor, this question is best for a lawyer.

From r/epilepsy user:

**Apps that support seizure tracking**:

[SeizureTracker.com](https://seizuretracker.com/)

[Epsy](https://www.epsyhealth.com/)

[Nile.ai](https://nile.ai/) (got funded for a lot of money recently, and is now the preferred seizure diary app of The Epilepsy Foundation)

and many more, just search the related apps on the app store

\-----------------------------------------------------------

**Detection and altering support:**

A little more complicated.

Please note some of these apps/devices also have seizure tracking and medication management features in them. Most apps available right now require some sort of wearable device (Apple Watch, another Android-based SmartWatch, or a specialized device). There are some apps that can work purely on the iPhone, but they don't work very well. SeizAlarm is one of them, though it works better with an Apple Watch.

The main thing to keep in mind is that ALL of these applications only work for **Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures**. If you want to buy one of them, please keep that in mind. ***They will not work for focal seizures, absence seizures, PNES, or any other seizure type that is not GTCS***.

The **ONLY** FDA-cleared detection/alerting device on the market right now is [Embrace2](https://www.empatica.com/embrace2/) by Empatica. [Here](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf18/K181861.pdf) is their clearance notification. In the table at the end, you will see their performance metrics in a clinical trial across age groups.  Testing was done in Epilepsy Monitoring Units, so just keep that in mind. People in EMUs will be moving less than people in real life. They detected **84/86 GTCS** during the trial (**97% of all GTCS**). Their device gave a false alarm rate of approximately **1 false alarm every day (0.93/day).** This is likely to be higher if you are a more active person, and the high false alarm rate is a common problem for most of these devices (including Embrace2), though customer support may be able to help tune this.

If you go for the Embrace2, you would have to buy the specialized watch, which I have heard mixed reviews on overall. Unfortunately there just isn't much choice as they are the only FDA-cleared device that has undergone a rigorous clinical trial. There are other devices available depending on where you live though

**SeizAlarm** \- Uses heart rate and accelerometer. Not FDA cleared, runs directly on the Apple Watch. I don't know what their performance numbers are as they have not done any studies.

**Inspyre by SmartMonitor** \- Uses heart rate and accelerometer (I think, not much information on them or their algorithm). Not FDA cleared. Runs directly on Apple Watch, or some Android-based watches. I don't know what their performance numbers are.

**NightWatch** \- Heart rate and accelerometer on the upper arm, can only be worn at nighttime. They have a CE mark (cleared in Europe). They did do a small study and have validated results. It detected a **median of 86%** of seizures, though this included Tonic Clonic (96%), Generalized Tonic (89%), Hyper-kinetic (73%), and other seizure types (84%). The false alarm rate was **1 false alarm every 4 nights (0.23/night).** The scientific paper can be found [here](https://n.neurology.org/content/neurology/91/21/e2010.full.pdf), though you may or may not be able to access it as it is a scientific journal and might be locked behind a paywall. **This product is only available in the EU currently.**

**PulseGuard -** Heart rate for sure, don't know what else. I know they were struggling after Brexit, and may be out of business now.

**Epi-Care -** Accelerometer only. They are CE marked as Class I. They have results, though some are validated in EMUs, and some are from surveys. The survey [paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/epi.14051) showed a **median** sensitivity of detecting **90% of GTCS**. It also showed a **median FAR of 1 false alarm every 10 days**. The other [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23398578/) was EMU validated and showed a **mean sensitivity of 90% (35/39 GTCS detected)**, and a **1 false alarm every 5 days (0.2/day)**. **This product is only available in the EU currently.**

**Brain Sentinel** \- They used EMG (muscle activity) to detect seizures, I know they had a clinical trial with middling results a few years ago, but not sure what is happening with them now. They are not FDA-cleared.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Looking forward:**

There are a few new products which you may want to keep your eyes on for the future. Please remember that there is no guarantee that they will succeed in what they are trying to accomplish.

[EpiWatch](https://www.epiwatch.com/) \- A spinoff from Johns Hopkins University, I have seen their name multiple times on this subreddit. They started in 2015 collecting data using an app store app, but unfortunately have gone quiet in the last few years. However, they have recently started a clinical trial for a seizure detection algorithm on the Apple Watch, meaning we will have good evidence in the near future, and possibly FDA clearance.

[Eysz](https://eyszlab.com/) \- Middle of a clinical trial. Using oculometric (eye-tracking) data to capture absence seizures. I think they aim to integrate their technology with cameras and smart lenses, as wearing glasses while you sleep seems slightly uncomfortable. As they are also in the middle of a clinical, so we will have good evidence in the near future, and possibly FDA clearance.

[Nelli](https://neuroeventlabs.com/for-patients)\- Not exactly sure how you get this, but it is CE cleared. It uses a video camera to track you when you sleep and then will show you multiple seizure types, not just tonic-clonic. Seems like they sell more to hospitals than to individuals.

Epilepsy,Removed 20% of my brain and now I don’t feel like myself?,"I’ve lost the last 4.5 years memory wise. My surgeon said that’s not normal because he didn’t touch my long term. He expected my short term to be gone for life because of what he had to remove. Apparently, I left the man I was with for over a decade (big shock? No, dude was a dick OFTEN and I was the bread winner). I had to walk away from my career. I guess I met a guy who lives a few states from my hometown and he wanted me to live with him. He didn’t expect a ton from me. I guess we got married after hardly reaching a year just earlier this year. Problem I’ve got now? They took out left hippocampus, amygdala, temporal lobe and something else so I’ve lost a lot. I guess I was born with severe TLE (I’m 30 now) and no one ever saw it. I had another kind from a car accident as a tiny one in my front lobe they wanted to remove, but I had it explained they couldn’t because I stopped talking when they tested it so I will be stuck with those seizures. 

Okay point of this, my current husband seems like he’s literally someone I’d never invest time in. I’m confused. I can’t imagine myself leaving my home town or investing time in a place away from my dog. I up and left with him because my head is stuck 5 years ago and being in my home area was drowning me mentally trying to figure out what the heck happened. Surgery was about 3.5 months ago. My neurophysiologist did inform me without the left side I won’t think or feel the same when processing things. My surgeon said it’ll take about a year to see if my right side picks any of that up. I guess my entire life it looks like my right side was trying to pick up for my left since it was literally just most dead when he removed it and never functioned right. Makes sense why I never understood logical thinking after emotions. I always said I was the “emotional type.” 


My plan right now? Take it day by day because I owe the guy I married that and jump ship back to Chicago if I need to. Not being able to drive or fly for a while makes that difficult, but I can if I need to. ",1cot65k
Epilepsy,My husband’s employer is not letting him leave work for the day.,"My husband is a teacher at a high school. Yesterday, he had a grand mal at hit his head pretty good on his way down (huge knot on his forehead and cut up right side of face).
He thought he could handle class as it’s just senior final day, but he’s feeling uneasy again and asked for emergency coverage.
They told him no, and that the subs are in different classrooms at this time. Trying to guilt him that 4 other teachers are wanting coverage as well.
Is there anything that can be done now or in the future to handle this if it comes up again?

I use cannabis to control my seizures (on traditional pills I have 3-4 a year, on cannabis alone I have 1 every 2-2.5 years). But she doesn't view cannabis as a medicine. She thinks it's a drug like heroin or cocaine, and she's worried I'll get some laced with fentanyl. I told her that's why I buy from a dispensary, but she's still convinced all weed is alced with fantanyl, and I've just been lucky so far.

It's driven a wedge between us because I'm just trying to treat my health (I'm 39, btw) in the way that works best for me, but she refuses to do any research and just wants to classify me as a drug addict. She doesn't trust me, she doesn't truat my decision. She thinks I'm better off staying on pills, despite the nast side effects and the fact that they don't work. She says we don't know enough about cannabis (which is true), but we do know a lot. If I try and give her legit sources (ie, read the studies by Raphael Mechulem), she says it's just a bunch of biased research because these people want it legalized so they can make money. But none of her research is biased. Ever 🙄 I'm the dumb one, not her.

I just don't know what to do. Is the situation hopeless? Should I just cut her out of my life?",1coyrgv

I offered to help at his circus like selling souvenirs, ticket, running games etc on days I didn't have to work and he (maybe could have delivered it better) said, you couldn't handle it. Not the actual job itself I could do it fine but exhaustion, lack of sleep, low blood sugar are all things that are my triggers. And while yes there's truth to that I have to accept, doesn't mean I don't feel like a burden. I'm already I'm a mental funk because for us to get out I'm getting my CPA in PA where it's better to than where we live. 

And just the whole no driving thing always comes up like a turd that won't flush. I could make extra money in my off season at work doing doordash or Walmart delivery. I could get jobs further away instead of trying for remote ones. I wouldn't have to hit others up to get my errands done by driving me so he could do his own. I've wanted to get involved with things but well that driving and lack of public transportation etc kills that.

Epilepsy,The bus today in St. Petersburg ,"It's all over the internet, a blue bus that hits a car, swerves then heads straight on off the bridge.

That got me thinking: heart, stroke, ictal state. 

The driver survived.

That got me thinking. If someone commits a crime while post-ictal, is this person responsible for it? Even violence, a common post-ictal reaction, can there be an accusation from the third party about assault? The matter here: how out of it you really were, of just took the chance to beat up your partner? I am assuming here the seizure was genuine, not some fake.

Epilepsy,What is it like when epilepsy is well managed and stable? ,"I was diagnosed not so long ago with epilepsy. Prescribed meds for it but it still impacts my daily life a lot and I don't know much epilepsy in general.

I was wondering, after how long without having a seizure, even if it doesn't mean we recovered, can we describe it as the epilepsy being stable and not having recurrent or frequent seizures? What is seen as good amount of time without seizure or as ""not having seizure for a long time""? 

Sorry if it's clumsy I can't find another way to put it into words. 
But for example I don't know if it's good or not significant enough not having a big seizure in 10-15 days (talking generally, it's not the actual current time since my last big seizure) because it already seems a lot to me, due to having these quite frequently but apparently it's not that much. (By big I mean the big seizures including convulsions/a lot of spasms, body very tense, loss of consciousness, etc with a lot of symptoms before and afterwards like intense headache, poor control of body movements, muscle aches, confusion and more).

Because I still have milder seizures like absences or short muscle jerks here and others where I'm not in total state of awareness but not losing awareness completely neither everyday even during the times where I don't have big seizures for 10-15 days but when I don't have the big ones for this amount of time I wonder if my epilepsy is being more controlled and stable but got told this time period isn't so long and the epilepsy is not actually well controlled. 

I don't know if it's clear but yeah, to sum it up, the question is: after what amount of time between seizures do we say the epilepsy is quite well controlled and that we do not frequent seizures?",1cp99zr
Epilepsy,How to deal with 1) Others blaming me for causing my own seizures. 2)Low self esteem,"M/32

I have been having seizures for about 20 years. 
Doctors have ran numerous tests, tried numerous medications and they still aren’t completely controlled. I even recently had my license suspended because I had one (not driving) and it has really taken a huge toll on me as far as well-being/ happiness. 

Recently, I got into a big argument with a CLOSE relative because they keep blaming my seizures on me. They say that things I do (exercise) are causing them. The doctor refutes this. I have had dozens of seizures while NOT exercising, and they know about them. So it hurts me for her to blame them on me going to the gym. 

SO, 1) how do you deal with people that blame you for your seizures? 
And 2)how do you stay happy with all that comes with the blame and actually having the seizures?

Epilepsy,I never feel truly understood. ,"I was diagnosed with epilepsy a few weeks ago following my very first seizure. On keppra 500mg for a few weeks now, and have been seizure free for about 3 weeks now. 

This condition is so difficult to describe to those who don’t have to deal with it. I always feel like I am never truly understood about what I deal with. I had a pretty normal life going for myself where I thrived off of being purely independent, I went to the gym every morning and was applying to work. I went on long walks outdoors and enjoyed my independence. 

But ever since my first seizure (when I was hospitalized), I can’t help but feel infantile to others around me. I can’t drive anymore, I’m unsure if I’ll ever be able to drive again normally. I have to ask people like a child if I want to go somewhere even though I am in my 20s. I literally will walk miles and have gotten a bus pass just to gain some sense of independence again.

Every time I go out now I have the constant thought of a breakthrough seizure. If I go to the store or somewhere on my own, there is always the thought “will I be okay, or will I be wheeled out on a stretcher?” 

And when I describe this to others, their thoughts are “well, you can hopefully drive again in a few weeks and this isn’t that big of a deal comparatively” no, it IS a big deal. I have to take medication for the rest of my life and be under constant supervision, I fear of falling or hitting my head from a random seizure or injuring myself like I did the first seizure I had. I will never feel “normal” ever again. Even if I am cleared to drive, I don’t think I even will much because of how terrifying the idea of blacking out on the road is. 

Epilepsy totally changed my life, the way I view it and my own mortality, and it’s something that’s so hard to describe to non epileptics.

They told me the neuropacer has a 20% chance of success *but* it would a) provide valuable data and b) could always be removed and laser ablation could be performed if it doesn’t work, but that will take time. The laser ablation has 60-70% chance of success but could come with side effects impacting my job.

Epilepsy,Can anyone relate to this? What do your focal seizures look like?,"*NOT ASKING FOR DIAGNOSIS*

Apologies, I know this question has been asked before. My PCP has concerns that I may be having focal seizures, and as I wait for my appt at the end of the month, I was wondering if anyone could relate to what I experience.


Here's the most recent event:
Mid conversation, my mind blanks. No thoughts, nothing. Only a feeling of confusion, and ""is this one of them?"". I say ""um"" a lot, and put a hand on my face, leaning against it (I am not a face-toucher, typically). I may get finger twitches, weird blinks. I ""um"" a lot, and the mind blank feels like it goes on forever. They usually last 1-3 minutes, and often get them back to back (2-3 in a row). My husband says I look really confused during these times, and not like myself. In a regular time, if I lose my words or a thought it does not look like this. I have a hard time speaking during this time, aside from ""um"".


I also sometimes get massive fatigue drops where I usually say something like ""oh shit"", and I fall heavily into an object or my husband. I can't speak aside from an occasional whisper, and I feel such extreme dread. I grew up with panic disorder, and this is a distinctly different feeling. Occasionally I'll get tremors or twitching.


Can anyone relate to this? I'm operating under the idea of ""I don't know what this is, it may be a focal; whatever it is, it's really unsettling"". Again, I am not asking for a diagnosis. I've been learning a lot about focals, but I haven't come across anyone experiencing a similar thing (the info is usually about kids or unaware seizures), so I wanted to post to the sub.

Epilepsy,Can nurses read EEG? ,"

How likely is it that the nurses missed looking at the EEG curves if you made a 2days EEG? 

They were only one nurse at a time, for me and an other patient. 6 screens, video, EEG, normal pc they have to look at. 

They told me they didn't catch any seizures, or saw any on the EEG. But I will have an official answer in 6weeks. After a technician/ neurologist who ever goes through it. 

I am very frustrated. 3weeks ago I had 2seizures a week. But then a break, and now a couple of days after the hospital I am exhausted and almost had a seizure again not sure I didn't. 
I was constantly Dizzy during the two days, I am Dizzy every day, so hard to tell for me wether it's a seizure/coming or just my normal chronic dizzines. Doctors have sort of just dismissed that I am constantly Dizzy. Not really looked into that. When I mean Dizzy I mean constantly like an amusement park Dizzy and feeling like falling a couple of times a day. It's been like that for a long time. The nurses said it's probably because they stopped my medication during tests or because I tok them again the next day.
They made the test to see where my seizures are located and why  I still had two seizures every/ other week. 
I've been diagnosed with Epilepsy after my sleep deprived EEG was positive. 
I have focals, suspected absent seizures and atonic seizures. 
Now because of my assumed negative 2days EEG, I am scared they will take my meds away. It has helped me so much. Before I had 5-6seizures a day. I could not function or barely walk by myself. 
Last year I hit my head 3times because of falling one time almost the side of the table. I am scared I will get back to that because the medicin helped with the atonic seizures so I only have head drops instead of falling. 

Are there other people who has experienced having seizures weeks up to the 2days EEG? 
I just have a hard time not to think about it. Not that I want Epilepsy, I just want the help. 
Thanks in advance if you made it this far.

Epilepsy,Temporal Lobe Epilepsy & QOL ,"Hi, everybody,

Before I say anything else - I'm a bundle of health issues, and every new sub I find makes me feel a little more connected to the world around me. Thanks for building this community. I put this under ""Support"" as I was afraid it may be upsetting for some, but really, I have a few questions regarding TLE and its emotional consequences. If you can help me out, I'd love to hear your thoughts and insights :)

A bit of background: I had a benign brain tumor that they couldn't really identify the nature of (I know...) but was probably a  grade 1 astrocytoma. I was initially misdiagnosed, and thus it was not treated for several years, giving my tumor a lot of time and space to pretty much destroy my amygdala and hypothalamus. I underwent a craniotomy three years ago, and I've been attempting to recover ever since, but as we all know, recovery is a bit of a Sisyphean task. I started having absence seizures last fall, and I was subsequently diagnosed with TLE and prescribed Lamictal. Around the same time, I was diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder, which I imagine was also triggered by my brain damage (in combination with genetic factors of course). This leads me to the following questions:

1. Firstly, Geschwind syndrome. How legit is it? Do any of you guys have it? I suspect that I might, as I have pretty much all of the symptoms that Dr. Google describes, but it overlaps with schizotypal in certain ways, and I'm wondering if I should just let that lie or pursue it further.
2. Has TLE ever triggered psychosis or psychosis-adjacent symptoms for any of you? If so, what did they look like? Did you experience personality changes at all?
3. I've been offered an amydgalohippocampectomy in the past. For those who have gone through with temporal lobe surgery, what did your life look like afterward?
4. How has TLE affected your quality of life? Every time I rest even a little bit, it hits me how difficult the things I do every day actually are for me. I feel so drained, and sometimes it feels like I'm just stalling my inevitable crash and burn. How do you guys keep your chin up?

Context: I stayed up a lot later than I usually do last night (usually go to bed anywhere from 11pm-2am, wake up 9-11am) but my bf and I ended up staying up till 7:30 this morning talking, watching youtube video, etc because my schedule said I wasn't working today. Well I ended up back on the schedule no warning/context for the evening so I'm trying to work but my right hand (and it's usually my right side in general) feels off compared to my left, like it feels twitchy/more shaky/like a current running through it and I'd rate the pain at like maybe a 3/10 it's more so a mild discomfort and feeling like some parts of the hand feels like they don't exist? I'm having some cognitive issues and brain fog and severe reactions to noises (I'm wfh in market research so dialing and constantly getting disconnected numbers and just hearing that noise constantly is like nails on a chalkboard disorienting). 

I've tried to explain these issues to her in the past in this way but she's just brushed them off like saying ""well you've got to work"" or has told me to cut a pill in half and take it with my regular dose which I'm on delayed release 500mg Depakote 2x a day which is a wax coated pill and raised red flags for me. She's brushed off any asks I've made about making changes to my diet or lifestyle if that would help me like keto, cutting back sugar/caffeine and has put in my medical files that I have a dependency on weed because I told her I smoke sometimes because it helps combat these feelings/issues and the side effects the Depakote causes. She's been my neuro for the past 4 years and there's really no one else in my area except her boss(an M.D., she's just an fnp-c/anvp-bc). Not trying to diss her credentials but i just don't feel like I'm taken seriously, we never had an MRI done until this year (cat scan done and then an in-home eeg done 4 years ago, and two years ago she finally gave me my diagnosis of generalized seizure disorder after being prescribed 9 other medications and reacting to them poorly) due to the spasms getting worse in my right side we hade a NCT/EMG done around the same time as the mri she thought it might be nerve damage but everything came back clean and the Dr who conducted the nct/emg said everything I described to him definitely sounded neurological not nerve so im not even sure what she's going to tell me at my appt but work has been getting increasingly harder to do and ive had to be put on temporary medical leave(limited hours) for the first 2-3 months this year because of the issues and trying to make all these appts.

I'm just wondering if what I described in the first half are auras because I guess I hear that term and it just doesn't make sense to me when it comes to epilepsy, and if any one has any advice of insight about what I can do in the second would be helpful.

Epilepsy,Left temporal pull lobe removal question. ,"Hi all - I’ve had epilepsy since I was a child and was formally diagnosed when I was 14. I am 34 now and still have partial complex seizures at night every 2ish weeks. Sometimes later that same day I will get what I describe as “the feeling” which is a sense of cold outright panic that (when not on meds) spreads to a tingly feeling on the right side of the body.  When on medication it usually goes away after heavy breathing and trying to calm myself down. Sometimes it will move into a partial complex where I’ll black out for a bit. 

I have an RNS currently and it doesn’t work, I’m having seizures every 2 weeks and have had it in for coming on 3 years. Assuming we turn off/remove the RNS, there is the discussion of removing the left temporal pull of the temporal lobe as that is where the neurologists are thinking the seizures are origin. It would be a sparring of the hippocampus surgery. 

For those who have been in the situation I’m in (or similar), and have had the sparring of the hippocampus in the pull temporal lobe removal, what was the impact it had on your day to day life? Did it descrease your memory, cause depression or other mood swings, and do you still have seizures?

I found out about my epilepsy and it was very surprising at first, because I did not worry too much about all the signs before... Let's say I ignored them cause they weren't that bad. (I only have focal seizures of course). The only time I actually got worried was when I was on meds because of BPD and depression, and those were giving me sooo many side effects, which now I understand they were just signs of my epilepsy but amplified, like spasms, jerking, twitching and language impairment. Sometimes even slight trembling. Needless to say I was disassociated all the time and my memory was non existent... as an 18 year old that grew up as a gifted kid, I needed a support teacher to get through school. I thought they were ""normal"" side effects and my psychiatrist never asked me directly about them so I pushed through it to the point I couldn't stand the situation anymore and quit all my meds (stupid impulsive behavior, ik). 

After this very bad period of my life the situation kind of stabilized, I sometimes had tics and stuff like that but thought it was only my personal way to react to stress and sleep deprivation. A couple of times I almost fainted with a very specific type of flashing light at concerts, but again, never took it seriously. Also, 24/7 exhausted despite having 8+ hours sleep every night and was very irritable/disassociated if I even missed a hour of sleep, but I was told by doctors and believed it was depression. Also I had a few sleep paralysis and associated them to stress and anxiety... Well, the signs were there but never made 2+2. All I needed was a neurologist certificate and an EEG exam to compete in boxing, that's why I did it, and then the results came and honestly I was absolutely confused... Now I found out also my cousin has some form of epilepsy and by looking back at my life story I can tell that something was off. Also, my memory and language has gotten much worse since after covid (when my bpd was at its peak and took meds), but never wanted to admit it to myself. I did not understand much from the EEG and the neurologist has not completed the diagnosis yet because he wants to wait for the MRI results, but I think that they detected the activity in the frontal lobe and also other areas close to that. I think I also have focal aware seizures, the experiences I read here on reddit feel very real to me. They happen to me especially when I study or listening to lectures, and sometimes also when I'm having a conversation: it's like my sight isn't focusing on anything, everything is blurred and I zone out and everything slows down. Sometimes if I'm reading a certain phrase, it starts going on rallenty in my head for a few seconds without me understanding the meaning whatsoever. Thankfully they are very short. 

Now, after this very loong rant (thanks to everyone that made it here) I have a few questions that I need to find an answer to. I absolutely will talk about this to my neurologist when I see him, but i's going to take a while to my next appointment. also I believe that people experiences are very important to get a full perspective .

1. Therapy. From what I understand treating epilepsy even if it's a mild form is necessary because a lot of seizures even if unnoticed can lead to brain damage, right? So, acknowledging the amount of side effects epilepsy medication could lead to, wouldn't it be better to try first keto diet and cbd which are more natural therapies? My epilepsy right now does not impair my functions that much (yet), and if meds made my studying and my concentration even more difficult than how it would be without them, I think I would get mad. To someone that has a similar story to mine, which were your first moves after the diagnosis?

2. If the seizure stops and are not detectable through an EEG exams, you can get your driver license back - from what I understand. So, are you bureaucratically considered a healthy individual? I was asking myself if maybe, after meds/thrapy I got a normal EEG, someone would sign my boxing certificate too... cause I was very determined to compete. We have to use helmets anyways, and also I'm in a light weight cathegory, so risk of ko is very limited. Idk ofc it's not the main point, but I really love my sport so that is kind of heartbreaking lol

3. I'm a student, and I can tell that focal aware seizures have made my studying and speaking worse. As long as I can control the circumstances I can find some ways to make it work somehow, even tho as soon as I get a little less sleep or a little more stressed my mind is absolutely on fire. So , to people with this type of seizures, how do you manage to memorize things and study? Do you have any tips or learning method? My personal one is writing a lot, but I'm willing to try anything at this point lol

Thank you for your attention, I really would appreciate any answer / opinion you could give me. I know nobody in person that is going through something like this (except for my cousin). Also when I speak about this to people, they usually respond that they are forgetful too or that sometims they also zone out... I guess some people feel the need to say that to sound relatable but literally sometimes I'm just like .\_.",1cp1w99

Epilepsy,Irrational fear (I think???),"Hi all, didn't know where to post this so apologies if I'm in the wrong place. I'll try and keep this as short as possible. 

Basically, for years now I've had this strange fear of having a seizure from flashing lights. I'm not epileptic but I do have a ""sensitivity"" to lights, particularly flashing lights (I used quotations as I'm not sure if part of it is even real or not). I know for sure that I'm sensitive to lighting that is too yellow or too white, intense flickering and LED strip lights (it kinda fucks with my head, makes me a bit uneasy) but it's flashing lights like strobe and camera flashes that I'm not sure about. 

For example, whenever I load up a game and a photosensitivity warning pops up, I instantly close the game through fear. Or whenever I come across a video or I'm playing a game with no warning that has flashing lights my mind does a combination of, ""Oh shit, look away"" and ""I'm gonna just focus on the lights because that's all I can see and think about"" (almost like I'm waiting for something to happen). Sometimes I try to forget about it but it's always just there in my mind. These thoughts then cause me to become anxious and makes my heart race. It also sometimes makes me feel weird, most of the time my head but sometimes it can be several parts of my body.

I have a hard time determining whether it's the lights, my mind or even both that's causing it and it's starting to annoy me now as there's been so many games I've stopped myself from playing out of fear. I would really appreciate your guys' thoughts and perhaps ways I can deal with it. 

Thank you.",1cp0fqc
Epilepsy,"Memory loss, I need tips and tricks! ","Okay so like most of us here, my memory is GARABGE. Between the seizures, medication, working full time and being a parent to a 2y/o and 4y/o I just can't keep up. It's really starting to affect me at work and of course no one truly understands, which makes me look like a complete idiot sometimes. 

I've spoken to my neuro about this, but he basically brushed it off as 'it is what is is' and that he couldn't help. 

So, my questions is how do you 'remember' or avoid forgetting things? Do you use agendas, notepads, reminders? suppliements/vitamins? I know there's a handful of things I could try, but I want to hear from my fellow epileptics' personal experiences and learn what has worked.

  
*I wanted to add as positive note, a good thing about this terrible memory is that I can rewatch movies and shows as often as I'd like! If I know I liked something, I can just give it a couple of weeks and get back to watching again and still get surprised by twists or storylines.

i just wanted to know if anyone had similar symptoms because i just learned that focal seizures can also have the same symptoms as panic attacks.

- hyperventilating along with elevated heart rate 
- ringing in ears 
- nausea 
- dry mouth 
- dizzy 
- both days this happened i didn’t really eat much
- no strange taste or deja vu 
- i can communicate and drink water every time 
- lightheaded 
- i’m mobile during these events
- panic feeling or scared that i’m dying
- well aware of what’s going on, just scared about WHAT is going on 
- usually a lot of tension built up throughout the day (stress combined with being dehydrated and not eating)
- no headache before or after (normally i have really bad headaches before or after having a seizure)
- usually lasts 10 minutes 
- i feel better after i’m hydrated and after my friends calm me down
- can vividly remember what happened before, during, and after event 
- no hallucinations 
- no convulsions and i never passed out, i just felt really weak 
- usually anxious for the rest of the day considering all that has happened

Epilepsy,How to support residents,"Hi!

I work in a group home for neurodivergent children/teenagers, ages 10-19. Many of these lovely stars have epilepsy, and while I do understand everyone have different experiences, I still would like to ask here since 100% of my current epileptic residents are non-verbal. Some of them communicate with simplified sign language or pictures (PECS etc.), but they still need lots of guidance to use these tools and I don't want to risk putting my words into their mouths about something that affect them so deeply. We still talk to them about it, but more generally speaking. Their developmental ""ages"" are around 1-3 years old.

We are all obviously well educated on the clinical and medical process. We have crash courses regularly and usually one of us escort the residents alongside their parents to different appointments with neurologists etc. We also administer all medicines.

But the issue still stands; these children can't verbally describe in detail how they experience a grand mal, for example. 

Sorry for the novel, here are my questions:

1. What's the scariest part about a seizure? Is there anything outsiders could do to help dealing with fear around seizures? 

2. How do you experience 'coming back' from a seizure? Can outsiders do anything to ease the transition in and out of seizures? 

3. Does anyone have a VNS? Do you experience any discomfort around it? One resident has it and we regularly use the magnet. 

If there's anything else on your mind that could benefit me, my colleagues and most importantly, these children, I'd deeply appreciate your thoughts. Thank you so much!

Epilepsy,Seizure definition doubt,"Yesterday my SO had a strange (mini?) seizure while getting into bed, we were both just preparing to sleep. 

He felt an aura, left his phone in the side table and didn't have time to tell me about it but I heard him. It began with The Howl as it always does, then the muscle contractions, all his body stiff with his jaw shifted leftward. It lasted less than a minute (I turned on the lights and manage to put the timer and the tension phase was just ending). I know that he always takes a few minutes to regain consciousness, but I tend to talk to him regardless and I did, I said something like ""it's ok, it's ending"". But he responded, which was a surprise, with just a nod and after a few seconds he said ""I know, it's ok"". 

Apparently he didn't loose consciousness at all, his recovery was super fast and we believe it was from a brand change that he was forced to make a day or two ago. I know thanks to this sub that seizures can be very different, but as I was making another entry in the Diary to mark one I didn't know what to put.

It counts as a TC if he is conscious? It is called something different? Did someone had anything like it and discussed with their neuro? TIA!",1coq0lw

ChronicPain,"I need a hand from everybody, please. DEA is making more cuts to medication production, right in the middle of a medication shortage. Fight Back.","Every one here has at least heard about these medication shortages. This whole thing makes so little sense, I dont have to tell anyone here, these arent the drugs killing anyone. That doesnt seem to be the point, the point seems to be making DEA all powerful. They can end a doctors career with a whim. They cause suicides from untreated pain and laugh it off as Big Pharma propaganda. Now they simply make the drugs unavailable. Its done nothing to help the underlying issue, they have been barking up the wrong tree (legal drug) instead of protecting the public from illicit drugs. This has been a 40 year problem. First fentanyl fake death was in 1979. Maybe people heard of China White, apparently its new to DEA since they did nothing about it till 2018. They dont want anyone asking why it took 40 years, thats the ONLY reason they keep Rx meds at the forefront of the discussion. 

At any rate,the DEA is proposing further cuts to medication production. Thats their brilliant idea to fix the situation. I know its going to be hard to leave a comment without a lot of cussing, but try. I guess we should be grateful theyre giving us a 30 day comment period, they usually give 90 days, but that shows how important it is to them to keep Rx medication out front. They are too incompetent to address the real issue.

ChronicPain,How to get doctors to take you seriously,"Hello all -

I've received a handful of messages requesting that I write up a post on my tips for dealing with doctors.

For those reading this for the first time, I am a 33F with decades of chronic pain treatment under my belt. I’ve had a lot of success communicating with doctors because I’ve spent quite a few years learning how they make decisions and take in information.

Interacting with doctors can be frustrating and intimidating — but it doesn't have to be. If you are reading this, then you deserve the best possible care that any doctor you see has to offer. You deserve to be believed and treated with respect.

Here is my short guide on interacting with doctors to create a collaborative treatment experience — one in which you feel understood and are well served by your doctor. Please feel free to chime in with your thoughts or other tips that have worked well for you.

&#x200B;

**1. Get yourself a folder and notepad to bring to your appointment.**

Use these to prepare for your appointment. By bringing them along, you will be able to easily share your medical records, notes on potential treatment options, your talking points, and questions for the doctor. More on what materials and notes to include in the following tips.

&#x200B;

**2. Research what treatment options are available for your conditions (or symptoms if undiagnosed).**

It's always helpful to know your options. Using online resources such as Mayo Clinic, WebMD, and Drugs.com can help you to understand the entire spectrum of treatment options that exist. By taking the time to learn about them, you’ll feel better prepared and able to ask more informed questions.

Plus, if you come across a newer treatment that your doctor hasn't considered, you will be able to ask ""What are your thoughts on X? Could that be a good direction for my case?""

Take notes on any treatment options that stand out to you, making note of their potential side effects and any drug interactions with your current therapies in case you have questions for your doctor. You can find a free drug interaction checker at [Drugs.com](https://Drugs.com), as well as patient reviews on any given medication.

If you are seeing a new doctor for the first time, consider looking them up online to read reviews by their patients. Look for phrases like ""did not feel rushed"" and ""has good bedside manner"". If you can, try to avoid doctors who have a significant amount of negative reviews (or if not possible, mentally prepare yourself based on what other patients experienced).

&#x200B;

**3. If the appointment is with a new doctor, prepare a comprehensive medical history to bring with you.**

When it comes to offering treatment options, you generally want your doctor to act quickly. But, before they can do anything, they need to feel confident that they have all the right information.

Start by calling the office or checking the provider’s website to see if you’re able to download the new patient forms in advance. You want to complete them on your own time, not while you’re feeling rushed in a waiting room, prone to forgetting things.

Your doctor sees a ton of patients each day — sometimes 50 -100 or more. You will only have so much time for your appointment, so it is imperative that you make the most of it. That means, you should focus your effort on items that move the appointment forward. Your medical history will be the first item of value that your doctor can use. It paints a picture of who you are as a patient and what you have been through so far.

Focus on delivering the “cliff notes” of your medical history clearly and succinctly. Prepare the following for your folder/notepad:

* Any blood work, imaging, or other test results
* A list of your diagnoses, when you received them, and the names of the doctors who made them
* Any past surgical records
* The names of any other doctors you have seen for this condition and what outcomes resulted
* A list of all past medications you have tried to treat your symptoms and why they failed (you'll be more likely to obtain a better prescription treatment if you can communicate everything you've already ruled out and why)

Practice delivering your medical history in a brief and concise manner. By rehearsing before you go, you'll feel more confident and be less likely to forget something in the moment.

&#x200B;

**4. Write down your questions and talking points beforehand and bring them with you.**

It's much easier to fit in everything you'd like to get across when you plan it out beforehand. Take notes in your notepad on how you plan to describe your pain to your doctor.

**Make sure to include:**

* When the pain started
* Where the pain is located
* What it feels like
* How frequently it happens (i.e. is it constant or intermittent?)
* What makes it feel worse or better
* **Most Important:** What daily activities are affected by the pain and what impact it's had on your life. Be specific (For example: ""I used to be able to work out 4x/week, but now I have a hard time even walking on the treadmill for more than 5 minutes. The throbbing pain in my feet becomes overbearing and my legs turn weak until I can't keep going anymore. Do you have any ideas as to what might be going on here?"")
* **Also very important:** What is your goal for your treatment? Are you looking to restore physical activity? Obtain a diagnosis? Try a new treatment because the current one is not working? If your doctor understands what you're looking to achieve, then they can take the right steps to help you.

Practice delivering your talking points. You'll be glad you did because even long appointments can fly by and you'll want to make sure that nothing gets left out.

&#x200B;

**5. Try not to inject too much emotion into the way you communicate with your doctor.**

Doctors are trained to separate fact from emotion because if they didn’t, they would not be able to do their job.

Imagine yourself in your doctor’s position — you’re swamped with dozens of patients each day, all of whom are suffering immensely. Many of them cry, break down, or lash out at you when they feel that you don’t understand their agony. How will you be able to help all of them, let alone not implode from emotional overload?

That is exactly the position your doctor is in. They deal with heightened emotions from patients nonstop. They cannot afford to turn themselves into an empathy vacuum, sucking up all the despair in the room. When your doctor seems unempathetic to your situation, it’s generally NOT because they don’t care. Rather, they MUST keep their emotions separate in order to function and not allow their personal feelings to cloud their clinical judgment.

Typically, a doctor who is exceptional at filtering out their emotions is viewed as cold and calloused. But, in reality, these doctors make some of the best clinicians you can find. That is because they are hyper-focused on solving the problem that is your treatment plan instead of getting wrapped up in the emotional component of your experience.

Therefore, when you deliver your talking points and questions, try to avoid excessive displays of emotion. This doesn’t mean you can’t act human — just practice dialing it down if you think that you might get worked up.

And hey, if you do end up crying, it's ok. Just take a deep breath and allow yourself to push forward. Try not to speak in a way that can come across as aggressive or confrontational. Those attitudes can easily arise when a person is in acute distress, often without their being fully aware of it.

(This tip does NOT apply if you are in a state of mental health crisis or engaged in self-harm. In that situation, you should focus immediately on the emotional turmoil that you are experiencing and inform your doctor so that they can help you.)

&#x200B;

**6. If you disagree with something that your doctor suggests, try asking questions to understand it.**

It can be quite exhausting for a doctor to give their professional medical opinion to a patient who they feel is not listening to them. No one likes to feel like they aren't being heard. So, if your doctor recommends X treatment and you aren't sure if it would be a good fit, ask clarifying questions to understand why they recommended it.

**Good phrases to use include:**

* “Can you help me understand X?""
* ""How would that work?""
* ""How does option X compare to option Y?""
* ""What might the side effects be like?""
* ""How long does this treatment typically take to start helping?""

(Consider writing these phrases down in your notepad if it helps)

If a patient speaks in a way that comes across as closed-minded, it can shut down the conversation and defeat any progress that could have been made. For example, sometimes a doctor will recommend a psychiatric medication to help with chronic pain symptoms. If the patient outright rejects the notion and declares ""You don't understand!"", the doctor may feel defeated by their lack of desire to collaborate and find it harder to make the appointment productive.

That's why you always want to ask questions when you feel that you don't understand why your doctor is making a particular recommendation. Maybe they are completely wrong and just need more information from you to chart a better course. Asking questions opens up that dialogue.

&#x200B;

**7. If your doctor is stressing you out, take a moment to breathe and then communicate what you need.**

Doctors are trained to operate efficiently, which does not always coincide with a good bedside manner. If you feel like your doctor is rushing or gaslighting you, you have the right to slow things down. Always be polite, but clear and direct.

**Good phrases to use include:**

* “I’m sorry, but this is a lot of information for me to take in. Can we please take a step back?""
* ""I think I may not be getting this information across clearly. It's a bit different than what you described back to me. Can I try to explain it again?""
* ""I think there may be another component to the problem that we haven't discussed. Can I explain?""

(Consider writing these phrases down in your notepad if it helps)

If you have a bad experience with a doctor, keep in mind that they do not represent all doctors. There are plenty of other providers out there who are better suited for you. When you feel ready, try again with someone new. Not to mention, most doctors love to hear things like, ""Thank you for being so helpful. This has been nothing like my last appointment where the doctor did X and Y."" It's validating for them to realize that they've done right by their patient.

&#x200B;

**8. Be a collaborative and compliant patient.**

If you commit to trying a treatment, stay compliant with it unless you run into issues.

If you do run into issues, call your doctor's office and tell them what happened so that they can help — don't suffer in silence or rely solely on the internet if you run into a problem.

Make sure to complete any diagnostic testing that can help you and your doctor better understand what's going on, so that you can make more informed treatment decisions together.

ChronicPain,"I Understand Why They Flagged This Guy, Buy I Do NOT Understand Why They Look At All Of Us As If We Are The Same...","So I really like my pharmacist. I use a chain pharmacy, and I know a lot of people don't have positive experiences with chains, but I have a great relationship with my pharmacist. I have never had any issues with my pharmacist, no judgement, and in fact often times I get help from my pharmacist. I have even had discussions with my pharmacist about what the DEA is currently doing. How, when they first began this, they had conferences set up with drs and pharmacists who told them they were hurting patients and the response was essentially *we dont care* from the DEA (which he thought was horrible). Basically my pharmacist gives a shit. Which I feel like is rare anymore (shouldn't be, but is). 

In any event, I picked up some scripts this morning and one of the pharmacists was on the phone with the pharmacy across the street. I overheard the conversation as I was swiping my points card, doing the date of birth for myself my husband and children (multiple scripts being picked up) etc. He told the other pharmacist that someone named X (i *did* hear the name just not including it) was probably on their way over as they had just denied filling their hydrocodone prescription. 

They had 17 prescriptions filled in the last month, from 16 different doctors. One of them just a week ago. They claimed it was a change in dosage (the pharmacist at my pharmacy was explaining all of this to the other pharmacist).

So first, *I totally understand declining to fill prescriptions like this*. What I **do not** however understand, is not filling someone that gets the same script from the same doctor every month. There is zero reason for that. They are two **very different** things.

Second, i have documented illnesses, stretching over the course of years, backed up by specialists, and imaging, and I cannot get *any* doctor to prescribe me *anything* above my baseline prescription of 2x 5mg hydrocodone a day. **How** in the *world* does someone manage to lie well enough to get 16 doctors to prescribe 17 times in a month??! *Just how does that happen?!*

I am not angry at this person. I don't consider them, or people like them, responsible for the fact that I cannot get adequate care (even though often times that is what we, as chronic pain patients, are compared to). Every single thing in the world will be abused by people. *As people we know this!*

I blame greedy individuals who decided money was more important than people, and governmental entities who feel entitled to control me and my life. I blame doctors who took oaths to care for me, but decided not to stand up, out of fear, or greed, or for whatever reason. They were needed to advocate for people who, for the most part, cant advocate for themselves. A large part of what they chose to do when they decided to become drs. And they failed us. They fail us when they hurt us with procedures we dont need, or make us worse. They fail us when they misdiagnose us, and they fail us when they won't treat our pain. 

We are failed by many people, and unfortunately we will continue to be failed by them. They will continue to look at us and see the guy who had 17 prescriptions written in one month by 16 doctors. *That* is what they see when they see us. No matter how far from the truth it is. ",1coz7z5
ChronicPain,I waited 14 months to see a pain specialist...,"On the day, I travelled 4 hours return trip and waited over an hour past my appointment time to see the doctor. He finally brought me in and immediately answered a phone call. He proceeded to discuss very serious health details of another patient for 10 minutes, then hung up. He spoke to me for maybe 5 minutes. All he had to say was that he had no recommendations for me. I am on medication and doing all the things he would have suggested. The only positive is that he will write me a letter that should hopefully make me successful when I reapply for disability support.

ChronicPain,I had a nerve block done on 5/7 and it's been life changing.,"In 2018, I broke my back without a traumatic event. I had a spinal fusion done in 2019 on the L5S1 level and have had pain since. My state doesn't do opioids for pain and I've been struggling. I tried physical therapy, steroid injections, acupuncture, massage and water therapy. None of it worked and the injections were very painful and traumatic. I had asked my doctor several times for a nerve block but he didn't want to do it, why, no idea. I finally got him to submit to the insurance and they approved surprisingly fast. Flash forward to last Tuesday and I'm heading into the hospital for the procedure to be done under sedation. It was uncomfortable as I was awake but just some meds for anxiety and to help with some of the pain. They did 3 injections at L3, L4 and S1 and it's been so amazing. I had stiffness Tuesday night, Wednesday and Thursday but today (Friday) I jumped out of bed to move the car for my husband and I was back inside before I realized that I had bent and gone down steps (which have killed me for years) and back without pain. To go from needing 10 plus hours of sleep, always being tired and in pain to being happy that I wake up in the morning is life changing. Dealing with debilitating pain for 6 years has been so difficult, as I'm sure you all know. I'm hoping that this will give me relief for a while so I can go back to school this fall and start working again. Anyone have tips for keeping the pain away for as long as possible? I hope you also get relief soon my friends! ",1cp2fz8

ChronicPain,Pharmacy issues,"This is more of a rant than anything in a place where others will understand. 

I live in a small rural town. I had used the same chain pharmacy since I moved here 15yrs ago. They got a new pharmacist who is an extremely judgmental dick. Only one there I've ever had an issue with. My PCP over the years has prescribed me pain meds and ativan as well as others that aren't controlled substances. Any time I pick up one of them he will tell me not to take them as prescribed and only use when I absolutely have to. Over time he's gotten more rude about it and questioning my need for the meds and just making me feel bad about taking them. 

I started seeing a psychiatrist in town and the pharmacist did the same thing said not to take the psych meds as prescribed. I told my psychiatrist what was said and he wasn't happy but when other patients said the same he called and yelled at the pharmacist and said if you have problems with my prescriptions talk to me but don't tell my patients to take them differently from how I prescribed. 

I ended up switching pharmacies to a local family run place. They are amazing! Everyone is super sweet things are filled within 30mins. No judgment. I had a few panic attacks back to back and my psychiatrist sent it to the old pharmacy so I could pick it up that night. He called and spoke with them said this is an emergency fill I want her to pick up tonight. She's not pharmacy hopping, not drug seeking and I ran a cures report it's been 1.5months since the last fill. 

When I got there to pick it up the pharmacist comes up looks at the ativan and goes so you need to take this spar...oh...well I guess Dr. Blank wrote this so take it as he prescribed. So whats your plan for your meds? I looked at him and said what do you mean? He said well you've been filling at the other pharmacy you can't swap back and forth. I said oh, this was an emergency fill the other pharmacy closes early and my doctor did this but I will be staying at the other pharmacy. I left with more anxiety and frustration.  

Fast forward to today about a month later. My PCP called in my butrans patch plus oral pain med for breakthrough. I go to my normal pharmacy and the tech said I'm so sorry butrans is back ordered with no eta for when they will get it in. We suggest you see if the other pharmacy can get it. My PCP drove to the pharmacy because they wouldn't answer the phone. He asked the pharmacist if they had it or could get it. The pharmacist said yes but we wont fill it for her unless she transfers everything back to us. 

Today has been a roller coaster of emotions. I literally started panicking when they said they couldn't get it because I didn't want to go through withdrawal. Then frustration of being told they have it but won't fill it. I caved and switched back because I feel like I have no other choice. I already have so much shame with taking these meds that allow me to semi function and now I have to go back to being shamed in front of others for taking them. My husband told me to call and make a formal complaint. I told him I dont think it'd do anything plus if I say it's about pain meds I'll be written off as a druggie. 

Sorry for the long rant. It's just so stupid the shit we have to go through. ",1cp71hy
ChronicPain,My trip to the ER ,"Yesterday the pain in my neck and back were too much and I had to go to the ER. I rated my pain a 9 when I got to triage.

My doctor was a very interesting man. He was from a major city about 4 hours away from me and his wife is a pain management doctor where they live.

He told me that House Bill 1 has made it impossible for ER doctors to prescribe medication for people with chronic pain. They can lose their licenses to practice medicine if they do.

He also said that Bill is why a lot of primary care doctors will not prescribe pain medication anymore. The craziest thing he told me was that Walmart is refusing to fill scripts from pain clinics. He said that constitutes practicing medicine which for them is illegal but they are still doing it.

He was very kind to me and gave me 3 shots to help me feel better. I was given phenergan, norflex and fentanyl. It brought my pain down enough that I was able to sleep last night.

Later today I am going to try a chiropractor for the first time and hoping that it will help.",1cox397

ChronicPain,It's my own fault.,"Tw maybe idk

I live every day in excruciating pain because I got hit by a car at 16. I'm 18 now, it's been a year and nine months and not a single day goes by where i'm not in pain.

The impact fractured my pelvis in three places, and I had to go through two weeks of hospitalization and rehab, and then four months on crutches. 

My hips didn't heal right, and now I've got premature arthritis in them. I don't think people realize just how important your hips are. I know I didn't even think about mine until this. It affects everything. Constant tension headaches, my back is KILLER, and my neck, and fucking everything else too. It all hurts all the time.

I've had to give up practically everything. I had to drop out of theatre my senior year after building up to that leading role since I could want anything. I barley go to work anymore and I truly love my job and my coworkers/boss are amazing its the best job ever, and more importantly I love the money, but it's physical labor and I just can't do it anymore. I am constantly flat broke, more reliant on my parents now than I was when I was 15/16.

I've lost so many friends because I can no longer go on random teenage adventures like hiking up the side of a mountain that you're definitely not supposed to hike up, or randomly going to the trampoline park, etc. I quite literally have no friends left irl.

Regular medicine like ibuprofen and tylenol don't do shit, specifically for my hips but it seems like they don't even work for the other pains atp either. And, you guessed it, I live in the good ole US of A, so I'm just stuck waiting for my stupid fucking referral to go through so I can gets meds or physical therapy or SOMETHING. Yes, that means I currently have absolutely nothing to help me except my own accommodations.

I won't be walking at graduation because I missed too much school because of my hips and now have to do summer school after my senior year. And then what do I do after? I feel trapped in this useless body. 

Sitting isn't much better than standing so a wheelchair wouldn't even help. 

The absolute worst part of all of it, is that I did this to myself. Legally, I was at fault for the accident, because apparently in my state (moved here about a year before the accident) you're supposed to walk things like bikes across intersections. Did I know that? No. Is that stupid goddamn intersection still only a two way stop when it needs to be a four way stop at LEAST, if not a trafficlight intersection? Yes. But my anger and resentment don't change the fact that legally, I was in the wrong, and it's my own fault I was permanently disabled at 16. 

I'm so depressed. It feels like my youth and future was taken from me all at once, all because of a stupid mistake I made at 16. Ik whose fault it was doesn't and wouldn't change anything about my current situation, but it doesn't make me feel any better. 

I truly, genuinely hate my life.",1cp8d3t
ChronicPain,Am I Crazy???,"I’ve been seeing this pain management doc for almost a year now maybe and from the start it’s been….different? It’s their own private practice and they do things traditionally by their own standards and old style through the book, no digital records, etc. which is like ok, fine. If you’re going to help me no problem.

But the issue I am having is they haven’t really seemed to have diagnose me or help me. I did all these tests, went and got the MRIs, and started the injections, and…nothing is helping? I asked for the doctor (he’s the one who owns the practice) to fill out the disability placard paperwork last month to which they said they will see and there will be a fee attached to do so. I inquired at my appointment the other day of the status on it and the receptionist told me “well he’s waiting.” I’m like “huh? Waiting on what?” She stated he’s waiting for now and didn’t really give much to it.

I guess he doesn’t believe I’m disabled enough or something for it but she’s going to keep it out for my next appointment next month. I am just tired of it as I am literally in pain 24/7 and struggling to get around the way it is. I’m not asking for accommodations for fun. Half the time he forgets what procedures he has or hasn’t done for me and I have to tell them I HAVE done a lumbar injection which he said we’ve never done before. I’m like wtf is going on here? I think I’m just tired of his practice at this point and they keep bringing up my overdue bill from before when I had double insurance and my deductible wasn’t paid up yet ugh. Should I just call it quits and find someone else?

EDIT: Thanks to everyone adding their view so far. I submitted my post during a really bad flare up when a day after my most recent appointment. I’m sure a few of you can relate. 

I definitely will be looking into a new provider for pain management care who will be more communicative and open. I don’t appreciate sneaky or pushing to the side practices. Hopefully things will work out better this way. Hoping for better results - now to look for in network providers!",1cozybn

ChronicPain,Can you explain me what is stenosis?,"""M99.73: Connective tissue and disc stenosis of intervertebral foramina Lumbar region""

What is this beast? What should I expect from it? Doctor only told that two discs in my lumbar region are too soft and a bit too tight. It hurts really badly when I stand vertically or walk, and gets progressively worse the longer I stand. The type of pain that isn't as bad as sharp tooth pain or accute kidney stone, it's a bit more dull, but it's so damn persistent it doesn't give me a break. Also if I walk/stand for too long it stays even when I lay down to have a rest.

NSAIDs help to take away this after-pain, but do nothing when I'm standing and walking.

With Tilidine I have a bit more endurance, and can stand walk for some time without any pain, before back gets tired. Then it comes back, just a little bit more dull.

My understanding that discs got slowly damaged over the years, it accumulated and turned to this. Physiotherapists keep telling me about strenghtening back muscles, but excercies they showing only make it worse. (and no it's not muscle pain) 

The only reliable way to manage it is not to get up, not stand, not walk and to sleep on the couch (bed is too soft and also make pain worse), eat a lot of Ibuprofen. Then it can go away completely, and I can even walk for a little while before it comes back again. I've read the rules and I have seen doctors, but it's going slow, and I want to hear people who actually know how it feels. What should I expect from it, and how bad it gets over time. Because I always had some problems with my lower back, but it only got that bad a few months ago. 

I also summon any Europeans and want to hear your experience with the doctors. I see a lot of people from United States in this subreddit and due to US's \*history\* with opiods, everyone is paranoid about those. But I am in Hamburg and it doesn't seem to be the case.

i’ve gotten used to saying yes to the question “are you okay to walk?” even if it’ll affect me later. i have gotten so used to going home and just being in irritable pain that it’s not even apparent to the outside world that i am experiencing pain. i am experiencing pain 24/7 and i don’t say anything about it. i don’t know what it is and it makes my pain feel invisible or pretend. other people have it way worse. i feel really upset about the fact that i have no answers and i feel shame in using mobility devices that would help alleviate my pain even for some of the time. my upper back and ribs hurt. my knees hurt. my ankles hurt. my lower back hurts. my neck hurts. i get pelvic floor spasms. my joints pop out of place. sometimes it feels unbearable to even be laying down to go to sleep. i have stopped saying yes to going out past a certain time at night because i crash at like 5-7pm and then travelling home is the worst. i often give myself shin splints just from walking. i push myself to do laborious work just to get paid but being on my feel for long periods of time is just not something i think is manageable anymore. i throw up a lot and react to a lot of foods that i’m not allergic to. i’ve been thinking a lot about being an ambulatory wheelchair user. i feel like it would benefit me more than using a cane as i sometimes do now. my cane gets in my way and i feel as though if i had a wheelchair i could still do the same things i do now just without walking. i feel like so much would be easier if i didn’t have to walk or stand. i’ve been experiencing chronic pain for 3+ years now and i feel like i’m so exhausted about going on like this. when i walk around my house i walk really weirdly because it’s what makes me feel comfortable, but when i’m in public i walk “normally” because it’s more efficient. i also find that toe walking is more comfortable than walking flat on my feet. i don’t know why that is. i also feel extremely tired all the time and i often go days where i only get up if absolutely necessary like to get water or go to the bathroom.

(F, 22) Last July, my left eye randomly began to hurt and swell up and hasn't gone away since. I have seen optometry multiple times, as well as ophthalmology. At ophthalmology, they fully examined my eye and tried to probe it but were unsuccessful because my puncture was ""too small"". They told me after multiple visits they didn't think it was eye-related but maybe that I had trigimenal neuralgia or a sinus issue.

I went to the ENT doctor and he examined my sinuses with a camera and reviewed my CT scan which ruled that out. However, he said I did have two retention cysts which shouldn't cause any problems. The one on the right side was the bigger one as well. I had an MRI as well and nothing to pinpoint it. My doctor ruled out trigeminal neuralgia as well. This is so frustrating. I was sent back to ophthalmology just for the doctor to tell me she doesn't know what I have but to keep trying to use eyedrops 😐.

I've been on three rounds of antibiotics, eye drops (anti-inflammatory, antibiotic), eye ointments (anti-inflammatory, antibiotics), cold compresses, and warm compresses and nothing. The vision in my left eye seems blurry, yet my eye exams come back 20/20. I have eye pain and swelling 24/7, sometimes it does make me dizzy and nauseous. The pain is felt in the part closest to the corner of my face. Does anyone have any idea what this could be? This has been so draining. I have an appointment coming up with ocuplastic in a couple days but I am nervous they will tell me they don't know like all the other doctors.",1cp52xv

ChronicPain,Hope? With my pain story,"Does anyone actually still have hope from new treatments?

I have a nerve root block on Monday and feel nothing about it. Not nervous or anxious or hopeful. Just nothing 

My story (warning very long):

I (24f) have experienced chronic ankle/leg pain for the last 10.5 years after a sprain. I've tried lots of different medications and creams. Nothing worked. I've had x-rays, MRI'S  and ultrasounds which show nothing.


I saw a pain management doctor and orthopaedic doctor at 13. The ortho said it was CRPS but pain management disagreed, I worked with the pain management physio for a while. At the time i hated the pain management doctor as he said well you can sit like this so youre clearly not in as much pain as you're saying. 


I saw the adult ortho and had surgery to remove inflammation but afterwards i was still in a great deal of pain. There  was a long period of oh well the orthopaedic doctors can't help you so you're just going to have to put up.

At the same time as all of this I developed stomach pain. Which they gave meds for and pain management were sure it was IBS. Saw a gastroenterologist they said no more likely to be gynaecological. Saw gynaecology who did a laparoscopy they found endometriosis.

Still went a while with lots of pain. I kept going back to my GP and they were very unhelpful. I saw a podiatrist who also thought I had CRPS and wrote to my GP who referred me back to pain management.

I waited over a year to see pain management. So I went private they suggested lidocaine patches and capsaicin cream 0.025%.Tried both and no use. I developed a reaction to the adhesive in the patches. 

I saw nhs pain management said not CRPS just allodynia and most likely IBS as well. But I was finally told IT'S NOT IN MY HEAD 🥳Suggested I saw a dietitian and some creams and medication to try. Again no use. Dietitian said definitely not IBS (surprise surprise 🙄) 

I suffered greatly in the winter with not being able to wear a sock and living in crocs because all other shoes hurt.  So back again I went. They said let's try an MRI of your back since we've never looked there and we'll refer you to another hospital who can do a treatmentof capsaicincream thats 8%. They sound a small paracentral disc extrusion and facet joint degeneration. This is an incidental finding and until they do a nerve root block they won't know if it's causing my leg pain ",1coyn94

ChronicPain,Update to Tygress’ back pain saga,"I wanted to finally give another update. It feels helpful to spew into the ether so if you decide to read, I appreciate it but if you skip it, that’s fine too.

RECAP: I have extreme pain down my right leg from my lower back to my hip all the way to my ankle. I’ve had years of PT and doctors and no one has figured out why or how to help when it was only back pain, not leg pain. I had come to the hospital on Monday the 29th for the pain due to being unable to get to the bathroom without 10/10 pain just getting there on an office chair pushed by my husband. I was hitting 10/10 every time I needed to sit up or move my right leg. The hospital offered to admit me and they did a new MRI. They said the admission would be just pain management so we chose to go home instead with 10mg Norcos as Friday the 3rd I had an ortho appointment so we tried to get to Friday for more pain meds and a plan. Ortho refused to refill the Norco (“I don’t even write 10’s for back surgery”) and other nonsense. She wanted me to have standing X Rays but since I hit that 10/10 on the laying down ones, this wasn’t going to happen. She suggested a facet injection to allow for the x rays to make a better plan and put in with insurance for that. She wrote mountains (900mg 3x a day) of gabapentin, and suggested they would make loopy (they don’t). She confirmed on my MRI a disc bulge - but not hernia - at L4-L5 that is 5-6mm. She also said there is fluid in the joint space and a gap between L3-L4 which was her main concern as a spine ortho. Her answer to more pain management was to go back to the hospital and get admitted.

UPDATE TIME: Sunday the 5th I was in tears again getting to the bathroom and it took 20 minutes to wheel me from my couch to the powder room while I screamed and wept and wailed the whole way, then my husband had to wipe me. This is too much. So I went back to the hospital in the evening. The ER doc wanted to send me home with more Norco even though two previous docs wanted to admit me so we pushed and I was admitted Sunday night. I begged for Neuro to anyone who would stand still more than 30 seconds around me. Nurses, doctors, janitors - anyone. The docs kept saying Neuro doesn’t like to come etc etc. but they made some calls and I got my August appointment moved to Thursday the 9th, yesterday, outpatient. They kept trying to manage the pain in various ways but the best was Norco 15 every 4 hours. They kept pushing to discharge me so I could get to my neurosurgeon appointment. I couldn’t walk around the bed. I couldn’t sit up or stand. But they discharged me around 6:30pm on Tuesday night, the 7th.

Wednesday morning I had to use the bathroom at 9am. I stupidly waited because I was afraid. At 10am I decided it was time and I tried to stand to get into my desk chair to wheel to the bathroom. I forgot that they gave me the walker and I tried to just lean on the chair to get myself up. This was a mistake. My hip went into excruciating pain with a pop (just a tendon or something moving) and I threw all my weight onto that ankle, spraining it. I was still on the couch but couldn’t sit up so I was feet on the floor but leaning back. My husband came when I called him screaming, my poor dog was terrified as to why I was screaming and wouldn’t leave my side. My husband tried to get me up onto the couch more using the blankets underneath me. This had the opposite of the desired effect and I slid to the floor. This is when we called 9-1-1. Oh, did I mention I sleep naked? Five paramedics showed up to me naked, covered in a sheet on my floor in the den. They expertly got a dress on over my head and arms and got me onto a board and then a stretcher. I luckily got to go back to the same hospital. No breaks in the hip, knee or ankle but the ankle is sprained. My foot is swollen and I can’t feel part of it. But it’s not too bad as even with the blood thinners I had been on in the hospital it isn’t blue or anything.

Ok, so neurosurgery in the hospital instead of outpatient got called and saw me yesterday morning. I have basically been escalated. He is saying my disc is herniated for sure. He sees whatever fragments or whatever to know that it burst. He wants a steroid injection in a specific spot before attempting surgery. The only person who he trusts to do this injection is the pain management doctor who told me, “I can’t walk for you,” when I asked for pain meds because I can’t walk, didn’t offer me a tissue when I was bawling my eyes out in his office, and then told me, “You can leave, you know,” when I was trying to compose myself crying in the exam room after the appointment because the pain was so bad and I felt like he wasn’t listening to me. Same guy who laughed at me when I yelped when he gave me an injection two days later in my periformis. So, needless to say I never wanted to see him again, ever. But if he is the steadiest hand and the best choice, then he’s the guy. I don’t need to see him for follow ups. He is just a tool that we are going to utilize. That is scheduled for Monday the 13th, 10am. If by Wednesday I am still unable to sit up, then Thursday morning I’m having surgery to remove the fragments. The OR is already booked and we are ready to go.

I feel like I’m finally in the right hands - the surgeon has said he is with me now even if he never does surgery on me, he will be managing my case. A bunch of people here said they didn’t know why I was discharged in the first place. Not that it helps but at least it feels validating. I would have preferred to be validated without a sprained ankle, but…

ChronicPain,mayo clinic is no different,"EDIT !!!!!!! after reading many more posts on here mayo clinic is definitely a scam for chronic pain . instead of wanting to test me for literally ANYTHING the doctor immediately was trying to push for central sensitization syndrome and the 3 week program . in fact he barely examined me at all . i am absolutely furious and bewildered at this entire establishment and i fucking knew that shit was sketchy

in my early 20s and have a myriad of symptoms that have been getting progressively worse since i was in middle school. was so relieved to be accepted for an appointment at mayo clinic, went to the one in jacksonville, and the doctor was exactly as confused and unhelpful as any other doctor ive been to. had to beg him to run tests and some he just wouldnt and the ones we did do when the results came in ""unremarkable"" he didnt say anything about follow up or next steps and is just sending me on my way. i feel completely scammed and want to give up i am so tired of begging for help and just being met with confusion and dismissal. the only thing i will say is the place is nice and extremely efficient.",1coenh7
ChronicPain,can someone help me?,"Hi, guys! First post in this group. For the last few months, I've been having tests done for a potential CSF leak (brain CT and MRI revealed intracranial hypotension with all the classic symptoms of a leak). I present many symptoms of a leak ie- brain stem sag, posterior fossa crowding, low laying tonsils. I got my spine MRI results back and there was no leakage. In fact, there was nothing except low laying tonsils. However, my brain MRI/CT indicated a bunch of sinus issues. CT was on March 14th- Mild mucosal thickening involving the paranasal sinuses. The mastoidair cells are clear

Mri was on March 29- Mucosalthickening of the maxillary sinus ethmoid sinus and frontalsinus. Heterogeneous T2 signal with restricted effusion inthe region of the pharyngeal tonsils. No enhancingcollection to suggest abscess. Increased signal within the pharyngeal tonsils, likelyinfectious/inflammatory.  
I was not ill when these were taken. I still dont feel ill. If anyone would like to see images, let me know. 

The neurologist noted that I have lost the curvature of both the spine and cervical and diagnosed me with cervicogenic headaches. Also some herniated discs in the thoracic region (T4-T6) and some bulging in the neck (C6-C7). He says there is also reduced flow in the R neck and has requested i do a CT angiogram for the head + neck to rule out any torn vessels. Right after this appointment, I did some blood work and said blood work revealed that my ferritin is very low (at a 10). Funny enough, I have been in contact with Linda Leithe from Duke and she says I present with a partially empty sella and tonsillar ectopia...she thinks my brain is in HIGH pressure. I have had MULTIPLE diagnoses and i am so stumped.   
I've seen my MD, a neurologist, optometrist, getting referred to a neurosurgeon, ENT and an ophtalmologist. I have done a brain CT (with con), spine and brain MRI, CTA for head and neck.

I'm wondering if anyone has some insight on this.  
My doctor thinks my iron is fine and shouldn't impact me.  
My neuro thinks the neck is certainly a contributing factor, but didn't mention IIH at all.  
My optometrist says my eyes are fine (seeing him again today).  
I feel like an incomplete puzzle and want these sudden symptoms to go away :(

At the moment, my **symptoms** are as follows:

Headaches and VERY stiff neck

Ear leakage (often) and the pressure in my R ear is INSANE.

R lymph node has been swollen for awhile, is slightly tender.

Tinnitus (sometimes a pounding so loud my heart feels like it will come out of my ears, at other times, just ringing)

Dizziness/blurry vision (also black dots in my vision occasionally)... the blurry vision is AWFUL and is very bad in the mornings.

Shortness of breath

Pins and needles sometimes into my whole arm, often just the finger tips.

Blood pressure has risen

Palpitations and chest pain (went from severe to very very mild)

I am a 33 year old active female. I have always had back pain and ""slipped ribs"".

Here is the spinal report (but the radiologist missed a lot according to my neuro). I have also attached a photo.

Alignment is normal. Spinal cord has normal signal and morphology. No spinal longitudinal extradural collection fluid.

Vertebral body height and marrow signal is preserved.

Spinal canal is capacious. At T4 and T5-T6 there are moderate left paracentral posterior disc protrusions which cause mild to moderate indentation of the anterior thecal sac. No abnormal cord signal.

There is no mild to moderate face osteoarthritis in the lumbar spine.

\*The radiologist noted that there is NO mild to moderate facet osteoarthritis in the lumbar spine.... is this an error? I feel like it wouldn't even be mentioned if i didn't have it.

Conus terminates appropriately at L2.

No paraspinal soft tissue abnormality.

ChronicPain,My Pharmacy Is Awful,"I have no idea what I did to piss this pharmacist off…but my head is spinning and I’m really trying not to freak out. 

It’s time for my monthly fill, and every month there’s “something” that holds up my prescription; last month my pain clinic got seriously annoyed at the pharmacy when they’d sent the script but the pharmacy said they hadn’t. So, like every other month, I called today to ask if I would be able to pick it up on my way home after work.

The pharmacist “needed information” and I asked if it was normal that I’d have to repeat the same thing every month? He got super pissy and said he doesn’t have to tell me why he’s asking but it’s in case the DEA does an audit or whatever. I understood that, and I told him the name of the primary condition for which I require pain relief. He didn’t know what it is, they never do…so I offered the scientific name for it, because honestly that tells more about what the disease is than does it’s “common” name, and he got even more pissy!

I told him (or tried to) that I wasn’t trying to be difficult, I’m trying to answer his questions, and he started saying he didn’t HAVE to fill this prescription. He WILL, “because it’s a ‘syndrome,’ it’s ‘hereditary,’ and next month [you] have the doctor send the prescription a week earlier and have my partner fill it.” I asked for clarification and he replied “my partner can fill it for you next month. I will not be the one to fill it next month. I do not have to tell you why.”

Sometimes I’ve gotten pissy myself with this pharmacy, because I just don’t think it’s right that EVERY SINGLE MONTH I have to cross my fingers and pray I get the tool that allows me to get out of bed, move around, and hold my job. That every day, every minute, is a struggle because of the pain I live in. But I was NOT pissy today…I was baffled?

He made me sit for a full hour when I got there. The pharmacy was not busy, and I don’t recall a negative encounter previously with this guy, so I can’t imagine what his problem is with me. 

I never wish harm on anyone, but on the way home I DID wish that this one pharmacist would experience pain like what I live in and that he’d need help from someone JUST like him.

My husband is not diagnosed with anything yet but has been having worsening chronic pain for several years. Due to past medical neglect and abuse he has not been able to see anyone about it until he moved in with me a year ago. At this point, despite initiating an investigation into his symptoms, he is now in so much pain he is bedbound and suicidal and breaking down constantly. He hasn’t slept more than 4 hours at a time in weeks and can sometimes barely think. We are doing testing with his PCP and no matter how many times we’ve mentioned how bad the pain is the only thing we’ve managed to get is a rheum referral we had to ask for directly and we’re still waiting for a call. Urgent care prescribed nothing, did X-rays and all they showed was very mild scoliosis which is obviously not the issue. Labs so far are showing *something* wrong but all we have so far is a largely nonspecific collection of results like a positive ANA, newly borderline high A1C, and high CRP. Is there anything we can/should do for his pain in the meantime? Should his PCP/urgent care be suggesting more? He has a history of this pain responding to a 3 day course of prednisone he got for some sinusitis a while back, but his PCP won’t even do another short course just to help him not want to kill himself from the pain (we are afraid of mentioning this in a medical setting outside of his psychiatrist for obvious reasons) and we don’t want to ask for narcotics because he has a past history of bad withdrawal from them. We are at the end of our rope on trying to get through to people how much he needs help so I’m reaching out here for any suggestions on what to do.",1coggif

IBD,Lymphocytic Colitis fatigue ,"49 year old male.

Just got diagnosed with Lymphocytic Colitis per biopsies of colon. 

Weird thing is, I don’t suffer from horrible diarrhea. I do tend to get loose stools a few times a week. On occasion I also have floating stool.

My biggest complaint is crushing fatigue. I have tested low in some b vitamins, d, and my ferritin has dropped quite a bit (still in normal range at 96, used to be 158) but not anemic with normal red blood cells, hemoglobin, etc. Can Lymphocytic Colitis cause absorption issues?

Why does Lymphocytic Colitis cause horrid fatigue and general feeling of being unwell? I know the vitamin issues contribute but can Lymphocytic Colitis cause severe fatigue on its own?

Also, got prescribed a budesonide for a three month taper. I have been on a PPI for 18 years and always beg to get off it to no avail by the docs. Doc made no mention yet again getting g off the PPI even though I read one shouldn’t take one if they have Lymphocytic Colitis. Is this true?

IBD,"Help, need advice for chronic abdominal cramps","I'm writing here because I don't think it's appropriate to write on r/ibs, because the slightly raised calprotectin, the pain localized on the left and the diagnosis of non-specific colitis don't make me think of ibs..

I'll briefly tell you my situation, for about 6/7 years I've been suffering from severe pain and cramps to the point of fainting and diarrhea immediately afterwards, but I've always alternated diarrhea and constipation, I've always been told that I suffered from IBS and that's okay. 
In 2022 I started having pain in my left side in addition to my usual symptoms (severe pain, diarrhea, mucus and a little blood), they had me do an ultrasound and the left colon was swollen, I did calprotectin which was 160 , so they did a colonoscopy and the only thing they found was ""non-specific left colitis"", to this day the doctors continue to say I have nothing. 
I can tolerate diarrhea and constipation and everything, but I can't bear the atrocious pain, three years ago I reached the point of weighing 32 kg because I wasn't eating out of fear. 
Now, I have regained my normal weight but I still feel terrible and I have tried almost all the antispasmodics, the doctors keep telling me that I have nothing so there is no point in spending any more money to go to them, so I wanted to ask you, I know that the clinic exists pain for those who suffer from chronic pain, but I've never heard of anyone going for stomach pain, maybe some of you have been there? I heard that they don't prescribe opioids so I wonder if it would be worth going there, I'm waiting for your answers, thanks :) 

PS: I would like to know, if I were to switch to a liquid diet (like the already digested foods they sell, I seem to have understood), would I be able to calm the pain? Because maybe it's the movement of the colon to digest that makes me feel bad, I don't know, has anyone tried?

IBD,Advice on Prednisone Side Effects,"Hi all! 

I recently was diagnosed with microscopic colitis which means inflammation in my colon. They prescribed me with Budesonide - 3 (7MG) daily pills for 28 days then go down to 2 pills for 14 days.

Unfortunately, the medication didn’t work and stools haven’t been solid. Trips to the restroom are still frequent.

My doctor then prescribed Prednisdone - 4 (10 MG) daily pills for two weeks and then cut down 5MG every week until pills finish (9 weeks total of medication)

I looked up the steroid they prescribed and read people’s stories and experiences and to be honest I’m worried lol!

I am worried about taking such a strong medication with strong side-effects. I do not want to gain weight. Superficial problem but I just went on a journey of losing lots of weight and the idea of going back - UGH! 

Anyways, would love to hear people’s experience on their short-term use of the prednisdone medication. What were some good and bad things? Anything here is helpful! Thank you :)",1coejxf

Have ulcerative colitis and mild asthma - use 2.5g - 3g of Mesalamine a day.

Had an interspherinctal abscess surgery last year and seemed to recover well.

Recently had a laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair surgery.

Before the surgery we found a laceration / fissure inside my anus / rectum which was not at the opening - a bit deeper...and anoscope was required to see it.

I took muscle relaxants for a couple of days before the surgery.

I was ok up until a week after the surgery, had bleeding (likely from the fissure) once about a week after the surgery. After that my stools have been pretty good comfortable other than these new pains.

For the last 3-4 days I've been feeling sharp pains (I think Proctalgia Fugax) like symptoms in the mornings before my bowel movements and they subside / go away after pooping.

I've been doing Sitz Baths twice a day for almost 2 weeks. Since a week I've been using Diltiazem to help relax the sphincter to prevent additional fissures / lacerations.

Today I've been feeling the proctalgia fugax like pains more consistently through out the day - even right before passing gas I get a very sharp pain.

 My stools seem fine, I'm just not sure what is causing the sharp pains.

Any insights would be much appreciated.",1coht5c
IBD,IBD Patient - What to do next,"Hi all,

I was diagnosed with UC a year ago. I didn't have pains, just blood in my stool which would come first followed by stool. In January, I had reached a point where the blood had stopped, or at least solidified with the stool and I managed to keep that going till the end of February. I had a trip in March that I could not avoid and that made me anxious causing my flare up to come back. On this trip, I had a weak moment, where I ate some Ice cream and that caused the flare up to increase. I spoke to my doc and he put me on a steroid to help in the moment.

Now I am weaning off the steroid and have been very strict with my diet, but my flare up is just not settling down. I just had my worst 24 hours yet with around 12 motions (most of them were just blood and mucus). Because of the steroid I am off budesonide and that seemed to work very well for me.

Seeing me struggle with UC, a friend with Celiac disease recommended that I switch to ""functional"" medicine, some suggest I try homeopathy etc.

I have always been a believer in allopathy, but that might have been because I never needed to look elsewhere. In this moment, I feel that I should try other things and see if they work. I just wanted to see if anyone out there has tried other forms of treatment and how its been for them. Please do share your thoughts.

Dr office called this morning and said biopsies came back and I’m negative for h. Pylori but the biopsies from my throat stomach and colon all showed inflammation.

IBD,How did you get diagnosed?,"TL; DR: In your biopsy results what is the exact statement confirming MC as diagnosis?  
  
I'm a 36M, currently diagnosed with functional diarrhea / IBS. 

The symptoms started suddenly with a watery diarrhea full of mucus and while it goes around in cycles and I sometimes feel almost normal (but no longer than 3 days in a row). While my condition is much more controllable (so far?) than some of you in this sub It's still far from perfect. I can hold my bowels from moving and go about my business but it feels awful in my gut and I almost never go to have fun outside as it's not so fun.

The treatment that was proposed to me is taking 1 month courses of Rifaximin, this seems to slightly help for the duration of the treatment, but soon as I'm off the med it gets worse that it was when I got on it.  
  
So further down the rabbit whole of supposed IBS I was prescribed Sertraline (what Zoloft is called here in Spain).  
On the second day of the treatment it got as bad as it ever was, almost like I'm doing colonoscopy preps. Sarted googling and soon enough MC came up as a possible side-effect. Which got me thinking if MC might not be the side-effect but is instead the actual condition I'm experiencing.  
Out of 5 doctors who have reviewed me after the colonoscopy results not one has suggested it, but the results themselves say ""mild inflamation of unknown genesis, increased lymphocytes"".  
Asked chat gpt and it seems to literally be how MC is diagnosed. But it's worth mentioning that the biopsy was aimed at finding helicobacter.

Hence I wanted to ask all of you here what do your biopsy resulsts say exactly? I'm afraid I'd need to do another colonoscopy this time aimed at excluding or confirming MC and the previous biopsy is not evidence enough.

Thanks a lot for this sub and sharing your experiences!",1cna480
IBD,Moviprep tips?!,"Hey all, I posted a while ago about having some bowel issues through pregnancy / post partum and I’m currently being investigated due to high FIT and Calprotectin levels in my stool samples. 

I’ve been given a prescription of Moviprep and told to wait up to 3 months for a colonoscopy. The nurse at the time warned me Moviprep tastes horrific and to use chasers such as lucozade if needed. I’m not going to lie, I’m more scared of the prep than the procedure. 

I’m very funny about tastes, I was given laxitives during pregnancy and they tasted so bad I’d just throw them up immediately. I just stopped using them completely as I couldn’t stand them and decided to grin and bear the constipation given I believed it would end postpartum. I’m so worried I’m not even going to be able to get through the prep stage. 

I asked my GI if there are alternative routes rather than the Moviprep, whether it be tablets or just something else and he gave me a very stern “no.” So… I guess I’m just gonna have to give it a shot! 

Any advice? What are the best chasers? Can I mix it with something? I’m definitely going to refrigerate it as suggested by the assistant nurse but I am very worried this won’t pan out.",1cn8itk

IBD,Question (tmi photo) hemmoroids? Should I see someone?,"Hi, about 1.5 weeks ago, I had some bleeding with passing stools… not in the stool. I looked down there and it definitely appeared to be a fissure in the side wall by a hemmoroid vessel. It went away. Then today, I had a stiff bowel movement again and had this amount of blood in the toilet, and some light clots. Looked down there, and again seems like a fissure. Should I see someone? I’m not in pain…. But I also hate unwarranted doctor bills…. But I’m also freaked about cancer (no history, just paranoia). Thoughts?",1cncmh3
IBD,Peeing blue after colonoscopy ,"Update: my doc says it’s normal, not common but can happen.

I had an colonoscopy 11 hours ago and I am peeing blue! 
My doc used a blue dye to look for cancer and other benign stuff but did not tell me I would be peeing blue! 100% peeing not coming from my rectum.

I read online that it can happen after eating the dye or having it through an IV but it was just put in my colon

I am freaking out just a little bit 

Has this happened to you?",1cmri4e
IBD,I'm about to get steroids,"Just got a colonoscopy for diagnosis and they think it's ulcerative colitis, and he says it's very inflamed so we have to do steroids (should take 5-6 days in hospital) or else there will be a 50% chance i will need surgery. No idea what to expect. I hope someone here can let me know what the steroids are like. Should I ask for a specific type?",1cmgkhx
IBD,chrons/perianal chrons ,"
I have been having issues with my stomach and anus and put off going to dr. I just went and they said it was concerning and scheduled me for colonoscopy next week. my brother who passed away had severe chrons and that is another reason they wanted me to get a colonoscopy so quickly. I have hashimoto’s disease and my endo was worried last year I had an absorption issue. I got an endoscopy and all was well. I just got bloodwork back and everything looks good. I am wondering if you can still have chrons when bloodwork is all normal? Stared in dec when I started to bleed thinking it was just hemorrhoids. 
I have had symptoms of itching, shooting pains, bleeding occasionally when going to the bathroom, fissures, some mouth ulcers, back pain, dry eyes, and tearing between anus and vagina that does not heal and will bleed. 
I just want them to find someone or diagnose me so I can stop having these symptoms. 
Thanks in advance. ",1cmh6nh
IBD,Blood and some mucus in poop after clear colonoscopy 2 months ago ,"23F had a sigmoidoscopy in February due to bright red bleeding for months and a juvenile polyp was removed. Bleeding stopped. GI recommended a full colonoscopy to check for other polyps. Got that done early March. Everything else is “squeaky clean” according to my GI. No polyps, inflammation, masses, hemorrhoids, etc. 

After the colonoscopy, my stools were totally normal for about a month. Then I started having frequent looser stools for about 5 days. That cleared up and I’ve had normal type 4 stools without blood for a week up until today. I had a normal stool this morning and then I went again and it was soft and loose along with some bright red blood. I’m so over this whole thing. I started having bleeding in August of 2023 and I had to fight tooth and nail to get a doctor to take me seriously. I thought the problem was solved when the polyp was removed so I feel so devastated right now. I have no pain so I don’t think it’s hemorrhoids or a cut. I feel like IBD was missed on the colonoscopy. I scheduled a follow up with the doctor who performed both scopes on Friday. I really like him. What could this be? What do I do? I’m losing my mind.

IBD,Really struggling tonight,"This whole post might be pointless and extremely long.. but I need an outlet, so manifesting my despair into text will have to do. In the recent week, I have been hospitalized over diffuse stomach pain conjoined with a panic attack. I was treated for anxiety, sedated, then eventually released. I’m worried that the lack of labs is going to hide my underlying trigger for the panic attack in the first place. 

It has been 3 days since I had that attack and I am still in agony. There are so many factors that could be contributing to my issues. I have a family history of colorectal issues. I have a history of “CHS”. I have a history of panic attacks. I recently had dental surgery which may or may not have anything to do with anything but my concern was leaning toward infection/sepsis. The feeling while I was hospitalized was agonizing. Like someone had their fist balled up in the middle of my stomach, squeezing the life out of my intestines. It hurt so bad but in a crampy “pins-and-needles” kind of way that would make it feel seized up.

 The night before my attack I had overindulged in an entire container of trail mix nuts. Peanuts and cashews, sunflower kernels, m&ms and raisins. I also had a small container of mixed fruit- watermelon, cantaloupe and honeydew. 
I figured I was doing good by eating fruits and nuts as my diet is usually hot garbage from fast food joints. 

That night I fell asleep face down on my stomach around 2am. By 5am I woke up abruptly and in a cold sweat.. in the middle of a panic attack as well so facial twitching and whatnot was happening. It was a MAJOR episode. Something was horribly wrong, I felt so incredibly nauseous but fought the vomit back. I pooped what looked like all my chewed up trail mix peanuts.. bits and pieces all scattered in the toilet. Almost as if I spit it out. Shortly after I was in the ER. No blood work was done but an ECG was needed as my heart rate was ~115bpm. My BP was hypertensive but this is all typical of panic. I was shortly given Ativan and benedryl to sedate me and then released. My oxygen saturation and temperatures have been mostly stable. 

It has been a few days since that happened and I’m still laying around in such pain and discomfort. Consistent nausea and it has me squirming around grunting. I have this achey pain in my back that feels related and lingers while I am upright. Heart rate has remained high since my release, breathing still feels strangely labored(maybe because of the nausea though). This isn’t even the end of it though. 

I had a dentist appointment I had to make it to today where they determined I also had an infection from my tooth extraction site. It had been around 2 weeks from today that I had a tooth surgically extracted. Today I started a course of amoxicillin to treat the infection. I wonder though, if my problems were primarily from a serious GI issue that went undetected or an infection on the road towards sepsis that was/is causing all my systems to go haywire. 

On top of that, this morning I had one of the most unusual stools and forgive me for the detail but the smell was absolutely offensive. SO bad. It was super oily and had the texture of straight up pudding on top of the water. I haven’t had another movement since that one. I also have only consumed 2 ensure drinks in the past two days and one ensure drink today. 

That’s pretty much my story and it was good to vent that shit out so thank you for coming to my ted talk. I just want to be ok and here I am.. squirming and grunting in my bed typing essays on reddit. 


Edit: diagnoses I have been given in the past ER visits include:
Dystonia, Colitis, Gastritis, Gastroparesis, CHS(Cannabinoid Hyperemesis syndrome) 

Anxiety/panic symptoms make it hard to relay that the actual problem is in my stomach because I present in such an alarming way and I feel that masks digestive symptoms.",1clxxjs

IBD,Subcutaneous Medication,"I've been using Entyvio with great results for my ulcerative colitis for about a year and a half now, and recently switched to the subcutaneous injections over the infusions because I didn't have great insurance at the time to cover the infusion visits (my current insurance covers all but $35), even though the move over was completed after my insurance improved.

Every time I inject though, I have a bruise afterward for about a week and a half or so, and right after injection the site is hard, swollen, and itchy. The injection itself hurts BAD. My GI says it's just an injection site reaction and nothing to worry about, and after about 12 hours it's normal again, except the bruising.

Is there anything I can do to prevent the bruising or make the process less painful? It sucks having to be careful of the spot on my thigh where I injected when I have to do it every 2 weeks. My GI doesn't seem too concerned about any of it, but honestly it's so annoying it's made me start to consider trying to switch back to infusions.",1clerk7

IBD,Worsening crippling bowel symptoms over past 10 years,"Hey everyone, I’m writing this on the fly so I’ll likely miss important details - but I’m trying my best. 

I am currently a 30/M experiencing worsening bowel symptoms. I’ve been to dozens of hospital ERs over my mystery condition and have been referred to gastroenterology but due to my financial situation and lack of insurance, I have been unable to get scoped. 

I have had bowel issues since I was a teenager. During those years, it wasn’t much of a hindrance and was more of a joke that I had to poop all the time. During my 20s, I started to have recurring bouts of morning nausea. I would have severe cramping and vomiting that would land me in the ER. Most of my lab results wouldn’t be definitive enough for a diagnosis so I have come back with things like Colitis, gastritis and Gastroparesis written on my paperwork. A couple times it was labeled as CHS due to regular marijuana use. Some things I would tend to hear at the ER are that my lactic levels are a little elevated and my potassium tends to be low (assuming because of vomit/diarrhea). I typically present with a panic attack at the same time so I’m treated for those symptoms in tandem with stomach spasms etc. 

Most recently, I have been in the ER 3 times within a 10-day period. I’m at a loss. I know the emergency department can only do so much for gastrointestinal issues but when an episode hits me, I lose control. Panic symptoms cause my face, hands and stomach to go numb with pins and needles. Facial twitching. The old sense of doom that convinces me I’m dying because something in my GI feels like it’s shutting down. 

Stools are regularly narrow with flattened sides showing that it is being squeezed through. The rest of the time, stools are loose and cloudy. I usually see the contents of undigested material when I look. I feel exhausted and weak all the time despite how I adjust my diet and it really feels like I’m not absorbing the nutrients from my meals. I drink ensure often to supplement the loss. 

Whatever is going on will completely debilitate me for days, and I don’t have the money to afford missing time like that. I work full time but I don’t make a lot of money and I don’t have insurance so it feels like I’m stuck in a loop of rushing to the ER when an episode hits, getting stabilized but not treated for the root problem, then I’m back out on the road hoping and praying that another episode doesn’t hit me again anytime soon. Even though it often does. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what resources I have available to me, I do t know how to find the doctors I need, I don’t know how assistance works nor how to get it, I don’t know what I need. I’m just so lost and the depression is really tough. I feel like my life is being ripped away from me. 

Sorry for the long post, but thank you for your time. ",1ckw6vo

IBD,Anyone else affected by recurrent yeast infections?,"I was diagnosed with IBD when I was 11 and have been on a biologic since I was 20.

IBD,Intro & Advice Needed,"Hi, new here. I'm 35F who started steadily losing weight and having bowel changes almost 2 years ago after having my son.

IBD,Question about flu and mesavant ,"Hello IBD Friends 
I'm from Canada and traveling in Europe right now and I just started mesavant on April 25 for mild IBD.

I'm experiencing a horrible flu like symptoms, chills with aches and pains. I took some ibuprofen yesterday and 1 reg strength this morning. I didn't realize that I wasn't supposed to take those types of NSaid with mesavant. I was feeling so good and much improved until Friday night/Saturday morning. 

My husband is picking up cold and flu paracetamol. Is that a good option?

Could I just have picked up a bug? Been tired and dehydrated? Got caught in the rain the other day and then the flu symptoms started. Diarrhea has been minimal (2-3x day)

And a little update: She was hospitalized Wednesday, prepped on Thursday, and had her scope around noon today. She’s doing great. This girl was ALL smiles and giggles heading into the OR, you would’ve thought we were sending her to Disney :) Her GI came out afterwards and told me that while things do look improved (yay!), unfortunately not enough to keep her on the Entyvio clinical trial. He is recommending Rinvoq or Xeljanz as next steps. Just looking on Google (I know I know) this looks absolutely terrifying. But I 100% trust our GI. I have a couple questions for any of you who may know or have experience with either of these 2 medications:

1) Did it work?

2) Side effects? I’m used to the scary looking cancer side effects, as she’s been on Remicade & Entyvio before. But this looks even scarier.

3) Please don’t judge me for asking this. Is there any (promising) data out there on pregnancy/conception for these 2 drugs? Everywhere I look just says “could cause harm based on animal studies, not known for sure.”  I know I’m probably insane… she’s 6 years old, still has a loooong ways to go, she might not even want a family in the future. Which is completely fine. But I really want that door to be open for her, if she so chooses. 

Thank you for reading my ramble :) Any insight would be very appreciated ❤️

I know this can affect anywhere in your digestive tract, but over 2 months of hardly being able to swallow, swollen lymph nodes, and ear pain is Crohns?

CrohnsDisease,How would you feel?,"Hello! Sorry I just wanted to get some outside opinions and perspective. This subject is very sensitive to me and I want to make sure I am not overreacting for being upset. 

I have had chrohns for a few years and, during that time I had been in and out of the ER and, was having really bad complications because I was unmedicated and undiagnosed. I had some really awful medical care at times and, it made me really depressed for a while because I internalized a lot of what was happening to me and blamed myself because for awhile they couldn’t figure out what was wrong with me so I suffered in pain for close to a year. Then another year of pain after being officially diagnosed because my body didn’t react well to the Humera. During that time I still had to manage a job and three kids and try to do my best. I also had to rely on my husband a lot because I was in so much pain in my joints. My back hurt so bad I at one point couldn’t really stand up straight or pick up my baby because of pain. It was devastating. Not to mention going the bathroom at least 8 times a day. 

Fast forward to today. I am on remicaide and have been in remission for a year.  Life is great or so I thought. My husband and I got into a stupid fight but, he said some really hurtful things. But the one that really hurt me was he said that all I talk about is crohns and he’s sick of it and, doesn’t want to talk about it anymore. I admit I talk about it but, I really only talk about it with people I am close to and comfortable with. I don’t have anyone else to vent to or, anyone that understands (he was with me for a lot of ER visits). He understands my situation more than anyone else because we both lived with the uncertainty. I mostly talk about it during my infusion time or if I am worried about a symptom or something. I guess I could just save that for the doctor and stop talking about it. I know it’s annoying and I don’t want to always talk about it but, sometimes I have no one else and some of the symptoms and side effects from the meds scare me a bit. I am trying to get over it. He never seemed annoyed or told me to stop until this. 

I guess my question would be how would you feel if your partner said that to you or am in the wrong? Am I expecting too much out of him? He’s very busy as well and had a lot going on. Sometimes I just really hate this disease and how it’s changed me. 
TLDR: husband said during a fight all I talk about is crohns and he doesn’t want to anymore. ",1cp4m64

I have no life quality, I can go out once a week and I need a week to recover. I asked her if she could perhaps sign a paper for my insurance to cover a wheelchair until I am better so it could help me manage my energy and have a better quality of life in the meantime of having help and she said ""I don't understand your results are better, you're 24 you don't need a wheelchair, you have great days so I don't understand"" first of all great days what where when how? Not true, I have ""ok"" days SOMETIMES, doesn't mean I am super good?!? She was SO rude and kept making me feel like I was exaggerating, I started crying, like I just want help and if you can't help me refer me to someone PLEASE and she did nothing as if I was fine. I see generalists they tell me to go to my specialists, my specialists tell me to go to a generalist to figure out whats wrong they keep relaying the ball to each other, in the meantime I'm stuck in the four walls of my apartment lonely, exhausted and in pain.

CrohnsDisease,Rinvoq Acne - Now vs Later?,"Hi there, I've been on 40 mg of Rinvoq since the end of February. I'm about to go down to 15mg starting tonight. I have had pretty bad acne as a side effect, and I'm wondering what kind of difference lowering the dose will have. 

I have a lot of small cysts on my arms, back, and chest. It also gets bad near my hairline and jawline. If you've experienced similar symptoms, how much did your skin recover after lowering the dose? Thank you for your respeonse an/or advice!",1cp6q2l

CrohnsDisease,"Doctor thinks it’s most consistent with crohns. Biopsy only says, “Mildly active nonspecific colitis” I’m confused",36m I had no symptoms my whole life except occasional straining and rectal bleeding during BM which an urgent care doctor said years ago was just hemroids. I went to see a gastro last week as it periodically came back every few months and I got concerned. I Got a colonoscopy and the doctor said it looks like crohns. He seemed very confident. I got the biopsy results above. Would the results specifically say crohns? He still seems to think it is but wants me to get an MRI and another scope in a month.

CrohnsDisease,Doctor going back and forth on diagnosis? ,"Has anyones doctor gone back and forth on a diagnosis? I was in the ER recently for severe and painful black diarrhea that lasted weeks. They told me I did NOT have an infection but that I did have colitis and ileitis from a CT scan. They told me I dont have IBS either and need to be seen for crohns. My initial appointment with my GI dr was decent and he agreed that even if the colonoscopy didnt show anything that he would treat me for crohns as it can be hard to diagnose. My colonoscopy/endoscopy was normal, I ask the day of colonoscopy for a pill cam, he agrees.

 At my follow up appointment he denied the pill cam, said it was just “infectious IBS” and that I need to see a rheumatologist. He didnt offer me any treatment so now I am forced to be in excruciating pain until I can get in with another rheum. Id already seem one months ago who only found high RF and extremely low vitamin D in blood work and dismissed me. I have been in the same pain since the ER, my muscle relaxers keep me constipated though. My lower right hurts so bad I cant barely move my right leg, he dismissed it as being my uterus. I feel like Im ready to jump into traffic at this point, the pain is ruining my fucking life!!!! Im shitting out orange, yellow, green, black and red shits every time.

I had some digestive problems in the past, but nothing to be concerned about. Fast forward to two days ago, when I got a bit constipated but didn't think to much of it until today, when I went to the bathroom and there was blood everywhere. I of course, panicked. I reached for some medicine so I can finally go and I just kept on bleeding, a lot, and I felt sick and dizzy. (TW to this part) I also noticed loads of blood clots, some bigger, some smaller. Of course I made an appointment to the doctor for tomorrow morning but my family insists on not eating till I see my doctor.
I am really hungry and weak as I think I lost quite a big amount of blood, I also haven't eaten all day and I don't know if I m allowed to eat or not :( I feel awful but I don't want to compromise my doctor's appointment tomorrow.

CrohnsDisease,Struggling to get answers ,"Hey guys. Looking for ideas. Over the past 5 months I've had to go to the ER twice for horrible days long gut pain and difficulty pooping, along with nausea and vomiting. All super unfun things.

In Feb I was admitted overnight. They did blood tests, and CT with contrast. Only showing very mild inflammation. Got put on a 2 month taper of Prednisone (40mg start). I start feeling a little better after a few weeks.

2 months later I'm back in the ER with the same issues plus now bloody mucus is passing (which is not normal for me). They do more blood work and another CT with contrast. Nothing remarkable. Put back on a Prednisone taper (no idea how long this time but 40mg). They want me to do a MRI Enterography to see more. Okay. After stressing over a week calling and showing up to the VA and such I finally got the approval for the MRI Enterography and had it done yesterday.

Nurse called today to say the findings have been sent and I can schedule a follow up to go over results, but that they didn't find anything.

HOW ARE THEY NEVER FINDING ANYTHING???? I am in so much pain most days I can't even leave the house. I cry on the toilet. It's killing my already terrible mental health.

I've been diagnosed since 2019. I'm on inflixamamb (my levels are within range, whatever that means for the med). And I take oral meds too. I take methocarbomal, ondansentron, dicyclomine and a handful of others.

I guess what I'm looking for here is any other tests or ideas to find what the heck is going on? Some days the pain gets to me so bad it's hard to want to stay alive. But when I bring that up all the VA wants to do is put me into a mental health hold. They don't want to actually help me not be in pain.

I don't want to be a drug seeker but being put on IV morphine when I was in the ER fucking blew my mind. I felt so happy just feeling my body in a relaxed state for once. It felt like the first time I could fully breathe. Opioids scare me a lot but there's gotta be something for me for the pain. Or finding what is causing it....",1coy7dw

I was on Remicade for a year and seen remission. Moved to another state and my new GI doctor (that I have now) recommended Humira. Was on Humira for two years and it never worked I was hospitalized and almost died. Same doctor put me on Skyrizi and I once again seen remission for 6 months but then SKyrizi started failing. Started Rinvoq and the loading phase was alright. I didn't get complete remission like with SKyrizi but probably 80% close to it. After the 2month loading phase my doctor switched me to 15mg. Full fledged symptoms it was almost like I wasnt taking any medication. So then he put me on 30mg and i've been taking that for 2 weeks. My symptoms are still bad but maybe like 10% better since going to 30mg.

My doctor wants me to continue taking the 30mg for another 2 months because ""its the best biologic and  i'm running out of options"". Personally, i'm losing my quality of life. I haven't been working out anymore and my job is getting harder to function with my returning symptoms. I just don't see how Rinvoq is going to start ""kicking in"" if it hasn't done much in 2 weeks.

Should I push back with my doctor about starting another biologic? He said my next option is going back to remicade but isn't too hopeful about it since although it gave me remission before he said my body probably built the antibodies to it since i stopped taking it.",1coi6d3

I have recently switched from Infliximab infusions to Stelara injections since I travel extremely often and have gotten tired of having to schedule travel around my infusions every 8 weeks.

A few issues and questions have come up for me in this process. My pharmacy told me that they generally only ship the Stelara vials every 8 weeks, one dose at a time, to be administered as they are received.

What about having your insurance approve multiple doses in advance?

Keto diet was attempted next… didn’t make it rage like the high fiber but wasn’t improving.

The past month I have been focused on the gut microbiology by introducing good probiotics and anti inflammatory ingredients. 

In the morning, I juice up a cabbage to make around 6oz of cabbage juice and drink it. I chance the cabbage juice with 6oz Kefir. I wait 30 min and I eat my simple breakfast of Eggs and organic applesauce.

Lunch I follow the same pattern of cabbage juice and Kefir. Wait 30 min then eat grilled salmon or chicken breast. 

Same thing for dinner however I hold off on the cabbage juice until just before I go to bed. 

Prior to starting this, I was having 6 to 10 movements a day. A week of doing this diet has reduced me down to once a day still have a little blood, but the frequency and the Pain is gone…

As boring this diet is it works for me to lower symptoms while waiting on the next meeting with my doctor.  Hope it can help someone in a flair.

UlcerativeColitis,How long until liver recovers?,"I'm sure there isn't going to be a specific answer but I was wondering people's experiences.

My doctor took me off meds completely, not even allowed to take my multivitamin, until my liver is doing better. If my symptoms start to flare before that point, I'll be put on prednisone. I had a liver biopsy which confirmed it was the biologics causing this problem. How long does it take to get from the 600s to normal without taking any meds to inflame it? I also have not been drinking since the enzymes first went up a few months ago. 
Also...superficial but I noticed sudden weight gain that I think is more due to the liver dysfunction than the biologics but I'm not sure. Anyone that has had this issue, did the weight go back down to normal when your liver recovered? I've always been skinny so this is really hard for me.",1cp5xrr
UlcerativeColitis,How do you stay fresh ”down there”? ,"This may be a question mostly for guys but I’m glad to hear womens perspective also.

How do you guys stay fresh when having to poop blood 5+ times a day? Even if I wipe myself completely clean with TP, I still feel like it isn’t that fresh down there since I just pooped blood and diarrhea. 

I have quite a bit of hair around the area which intensifies the feeling of not feeling fresh. Do you guys trim or anything?

UlcerativeColitis,Newly diagnosed Proctitis: relieved but also scared  ,"So for approximately 5 years I have dealt with blood in my stool, which was consistently put down as just haemorrhoids. Over the last year or so I had been diagnosed anaemic and was passing blood with every bowel movement, at the same time I also have pretty chronic constipation (pooping maybe every 2-3 days). This prompted me to be more assertive with my GP who finally referred me to a GI consultant. First time I felt like I was actually being listened to.

Had my colonoscopy this past week and diagnosed with ‘mild proctitis after 15cm’ biopsies taken throughout the colon and should hear back about them in the next few weeks.

My initial feeling was relief, I thought I was going crazy because how could haemorrhoids be this chronic?! Lol 

Still mixed feelings as the dust settles, feeling a little scared as this is kinda of a for life thing.

My questions:

1. How much does proctitis affect your everyday life?

2. Outside of the medicine prescribed what are things I can do to supplement the improvements of my symptoms?

3. What are the biopsies looking for?

4. Constipation doesn’t seem to be that common for most, has anyone else experienced these symptoms?

Thanks in advance 🙏

UlcerativeColitis,"So if prednisone isn't doing anything after a few days, how screwed am I? ","I am seeing my doctor next week, just kind of freaked out. Meh. :(

ETA: Thanks for sharing experiences everyone. I am have a bad flare for the first time in like 24 years since the beginning of this year. I wasn't always great at all about taking the maintenance drugs so I think I was just lucky. It's hard not to blame myself. 

I think from randomly reading in this sub, I got the idea that prednisone is a quick magic bullet even if it is a temporary fix. Obviously not always the case. Hearing from different people is very helpful. I'm scared about trying more with steroids and biologics but I'm glad to have the options. Really appreciate everyone who has shared. <3 ",1cosplz
UlcerativeColitis,Ordering food with UC; 10 years post diagnosis.,"Hey everyone, I have UC, thankfully I’m just on mesalamine orally, but definitely have had flares in the past that almost spiralled out of control. Obviously, everyone with UC has a different experience, but for me, a good chunk of living in remission has to do with managing my dietary intake. Anyways, I’m in tech and created an integration into UberEats/Grubhub that gives me access to 500k restaurants. I’m not trying to sell anything to anyone in this group but I am looking for people who can test it out with their dietary parameters and let me know if it’s useful for them and how it can be improved (all free of course) - this is meant to make the process of ordering/dining a lot easier for those of us with a cluster of dietary restrictions. Please comment or DM me if you’re interested - and mods, please let me know if this post isn’t allowed. 



TL;DR - I have UC for over 10 years. Staying in remission for me is dependant partially on dietary intake. Going out to eat sucks with dietary restrictions so I made a solution but need testers (it's free). ",1cp36xw

UlcerativeColitis,What would you do?,"I’m waiting to hear back from my GI doctor. I called midday and haven’t heard from them. 

I’ve been having upper abdominal pain on my left side for the past week. Not super terrible but uncomfortable, can be stabby sometimes. Hard to sit comfortably. Feel a lot more indigestion than usual (I usually have NONE). I asked gi about it last week and she wanted me to submit calprotectin test sample, probably to confirm this isn’t IBD related, and meet in early June so my appointment is then. 

I’m on entyvio and meselamine. I am waiting on fecal calprotecten results but I have had no IBD symptoms as of late. 

Symptoms are not going away, gradually getting a little worse. Finally went to urgent care last night because I hear meselamine sometimes screws with liver and pancreas and I thought it would be a good idea to get blood drawn just to check. Liver functioning levels are fine. Lipase level is within normal (but it’s at the very low end of a very wide range(???)). Neutrophils and granulocytes are elevated and above normal but other cbcs are fine. 

I pinged my GI doc today when I got the results to ask her to have a look and see if continuing the mesalamine makes sense but haven’t heard back. 

I am tempted to skip a couple days doses to see if that helps that pain. But it’s not like I obviously have pancreatitis or anything. And I have been on mesalamine for 9 months without issues prior to this. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Would you keep taking mesalamine until Monday? Also tips on what to do or ask for would be good because I’m not sure at which point does requesting imaging/referrals to other docs make sense (and I’m also hoping it’s not an unlikely nightmare scenario like cancer).

UlcerativeColitis,Bleeding while on Prednisone,"Hello again! I am currently waiting for a colonoscopy and bloodwork before they decide what treatment they are going to go with next for me.

I am not sure at what point I should tell my doctor that even the prednisone is not helping.

UlcerativeColitis,17 y.o. need some advice/encouragement,"My story:

It all started after a tough weight cut for a wrestling competition in March of 2023.
I started seeing blood and mucus in my stool soon after.

I've been diagnosed in September of 2023 after months of bloody stools.
I started taking Mesalamine immediately after the diagnosis and it did help at first, but then slowly stopped.

It wasn't really bad. Had to go to the toilet like twice a day, no pain or anything serious.

I went to another doctor and she gave me some other medication, but that only made things worse.
I started having pain when going to the toilet and it became a lot more frequent.

It got to a point where I would go to the toilet 15 or 18 times a day (bloody stool and diarrhea) and I had pretty bad anemia and could barely get dressed without getting tired.

That's when I was hospitalized, a month ago.
There I got a new doctor.
They gave me IV's, blood transfusion and Prednisone.

That calmed down the symptoms for a couple of weeks but it didn't really stop them.

I was out of the hospital for two weeks.
Anemia-wise I was feeling great, not tired at all.

There was less, sometimes no blood and I would go to the toilet once a day at first, then I would start going 2 times a day, then 3.
It was very slowly increasing

And whenever I ate anything other than plain bread, rice or chicken, my stool would be right back to blood and mucus.
That was on 40mg of Prednisone.

Even though I'm feeling a lot better the doctor said that my hemoglobin is still very low and that on Prednisone, I'm supposed to be perfectly fine and since I wasn't, she hospitalized me once again today 10.5.2024.

Now, I'm supposed to receive a blood transfusion and later start biologics.


Questions:

Is it really bad if even Prednisone wasn't helping?
Will biologics help?
Is it realistic that I'll be remission for summer?
How long before I can eat something normal?
How long where you in a flare until it got better, what helped?

I'm honestly exhausted of the diet I'm on, it literally has no flavor, I can't stop thinking about food.
Do you have any tips or anything that can help me through this tasteless diet, any food you recommend?",1cosgbc
UlcerativeColitis,When will the prednisnone work?!,"I started last week 5/2 on 40mg and my doc has me on 7 days taper down 10mg, so now I've been on 30mg for two days. Insurance denying maintenance medications certainly isn't helping. Granted, my calprotectin was extremely high (somewhere above 8000) a week in a half ago so I'm wondering if the amount of inflammation is causing it to take longer in effect. I'm looking for some prednisone success stories because I need it right about now. My diet solely consists of white bread, eggs, chicken, rice, greens, bananas and water. I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

My stools have blood in them, not a lot is coming out, or they're thin like. I ended up in the hospital last Wednesday because I had severe abdominal pain that lasted around 30 minutes before going away to a very mild and manageable bloat. I couldn't do anything during that 30 minutes. Did a cat scan with the following impression. No idea what could've caused that pain.

""IMPRESSION:1. Moderate to large amount of stool predominantly in the right andtransverse colon.2. Mild thickening of the descending and sigmoid colon could indicatecolitis.  There is no evidence of obstruction, perforation or abscess.""

I could use some help on what I can do to form my stools better during a flare and reduce urgency.",1cp2y35
UlcerativeColitis,Help re: fiber triggers,"Hello friends,

I have a question for those who are fiber intolerant

I was diagnosed recently with mild proctitis only (which aligned with my symptoms) and have been on mesalamine which has helped a bit. However, fiber still remains my biggest dietary trigger— it’s been hard to pinpoint and symptoms don’t seem isolated to the rectum. 

I have been very selective and mindful of introducing foods back, but it seems it is also random (eg ate some tomato slices fine for several days, then the next day it was the killer). Sometimes, this happens a bit later after eating which makes sense with digestion/transit. However, I am noticing that the onset can also be pretty quick after eating a trigger food—which would point to an issue much further up the GI tract (I did not have an upper GI scope).  Example: just tried a bite of flax brownie, 20 or so min later immediately significant cramping and bloating. It can lead to bouts of EXTREME distention where it just appears my gut is not digesting whatsoever (eg finally burping up a meal I had 10-14 hr ago). I don’t really think it’s GERD.

Understand we’re all different and much is trial/error—but is any of this common for anyone? Or has anyone had similar issues and your dr advised something that I could explore at my next appt (like gastroparesis, IBS, it’s just cumulative and not the trigger food itself, further testing or intervention) or if you’ve found any other rhyme or reason (even if it’s just yea dude shits random af sorry, would still find helpful lol)

With that said, obviously not looking for medical advice (I am medical myself but trying to find good data online about diet blows, my GI is aloof and insurance annoying)

Thank you 🙏🏼 ",1cp16lk

I asked doc about Rinvoq because it's another Abbvie med and their co-pay assitance is very generous. I've had no issues being reimbrused by manufacturer. The manufacturer now keeps sending me phaplets to ask doc about switching to Rinvoq. However I'm concerned about Rinvoq raising my cholesterol and triglycerides. They are already borderline and I'm concerned they might go thru the roof on Rinvoq.

I am nervous about taking these medications abroad as I have heard some countries have restrictions or could even arrest you.

UlcerativeColitis,Is there anyone out there like me? ,"Hi all. 

I’ll start by saying that I am actually not the one who is suffering from this horrible disease. But my daughter is. I’m very early in this journey but I am finding it next to impossible to find a parent who is in the same position as I am. 

My daughter was diagnosed after 6 months of diarrhea with some occasional blood. She is moderate to severe and her colitis affects her entire colon. She was put on prednisone in January and she responded very well to it. We started mesalamine which didn’t take. At all. The second we started her taper she began showing symptoms again almost immediately. 

We’re now on our second round of prednisone and have decided since she gets sick so quickly to start her on a biologic. So far, the prednisone isn’t working as well as it did the first time. Her poop is definitely more solid but there are bits of blood still. She’s had one loading dose of Renflexis (infliximab) and is due for her next infusion on Tuesday, after which we will try and taper her off the steroid again. 

I’m starting to think we may be the only parents in our city dealing with this kind of disease affecting our daughter. Because here’s the kicker. She turns 4 next month. 

Are there any parents (or patients) out there who have/are dealing with this in someone so young? I try to stay positive but tend to get down when I don’t see immediate results. Which I know isn’t how this works. If anyone has any success stories I’d love to hear them; bonus points if it involves a toddler. I’ll take all of the advice I can get at this point.

Have ulcerative colits and mild asthma - use 2.5g - 3g of Mesalamine a day. 

Had an interspherinctal abscess surgery last year and seemed to recover well.

Recently had a laparosopic inguinal hernia repair surgery.

Before the surgery we found a laceration / fissure inside my anus / rectum which was not at the opening - a bit deeper...and anoscope was requrired to see it.

I took muscle relaxants for a couple of days before the surgery.

I was ok up untill a week after the surgery, had bleeding (likely from the fissure) once about a week after the surgery. After that my stools have been pretty good comfortable other than these new pains.

For the last 3-4 days I've been feeling sharp pains (I think Proctalgia Fugax) like symptoms in the mornings before my bowel movements and they subside / go away after pooping.

I've been doing Sitz Baths twice a day for almost 2 weeks. Since a week I've been using Diltiazem to help relax the sphincter to prevent additional fissures / lacerations. 

Today I've been feeling the proctalgia fugax like pains more consistently through out the day. My stools seem fine, I'm just not sure what is causing the sharp pains.

UlcerativeColitis,Tips and tricks for living with UC?? ,"Hi friends, 

So I (23F) have been struggling with what I call ""stomach issues"" for almost half of my life. I was diagnosed with pancreatitis when I was 14… No one could explain how I got it but I was hospitalized for five days and went through some immediate surgeries. As I was so young and didn’t have any family members with these issues, we were VERY scared and didn’t know what this meant for me…..Fast forward I am diagnosed with Ulcerative Pancolitis in 2019. I was 19 years old at this time and decided I would ignore it and it would go away. (HA). I then went through many years of taking Entyvio .. on and off until this past year I went through a flare up that changed my whole life. Being diagnosed with this disease was easier when I wasn’t working 9-5, Monday through Friday. 



The flare up started in October 2023 and lasted until December. As some days were better than others I was still left with lingering uncomfortable symptoms. Sometimes the symptoms were chest pain, other times I’d wake up and feel like I got hit by a bus because my muscles hurt so bad. 



I saw my specialist a couple weeks ago. I was devastated to learn that NSAIDS and Advil are only worsening symptoms as I was taking Advil almost everyday. My doctor looked at me and asked why I would be taking these medications when he had been sending me other medications for pain relief…..turns out he had the wrong Walgreens/ Cvs. :/



During this appointment my doctor was very concerned with my weight loss. (15 pounds within a year). I explained to him that I have been feeling a mental block from feeling hungry from fear of what could happen at work after I eat or even worse, out with a friend, etc. He suggested a dietician and I am currently looking into pricing for that ( As it seems insurance does not cover much ). So, it technically might not even be an option. 



I understand symptoms differ for each individual but kindly comment on any recommendations, medications, and any ideas of what has helped you through remission and not feeling like the laziest person in the world at times. And, for the ones still going through it GOD BLESS YOU.

I had to quit my dream job, I’m on benefits and skint. I also have other issues with mental health following a trauma which in hindsight I think sparked my colitis.

Currently on 2nd biologic but think they’re about to take me off that one too because I keep getting infections and raising antibodies. Also started flaring again.

I’m sick of living like a zombie and life passing me by. 

I’m so fucking exhausted all the time, I have daily migraines, joint pains, I can barely walk for 20 mins, and nothing is putting me in remission. 

I’m just so incredibly fucking over having colitis. 

I don’t even remember what it feels like to wake up energised. 

I want to do things in life, but where I can’t work I can’t afford to do the things I want to do. 

I can’t find a work from home job, which would make such a difference to me. 

I’m just over it all. I want to feel the vitality of life again, I want the energy to not be always turning down plans and feeling guilty because I think people think I’m lazy. 

I want to be able to enjoy life and work and save money and experience things again.

UlcerativeColitis,My GI team is genuinely making me lose my mind. Any advice? ,"If somebody could please let me know if my team is being confusing or if it's just me. 

 Question for those who don't really want to read everything: 
Have you ever done a scope with no prep? If yes, how did it go? 


 I'm having such a tough time trying to communicate with my GI team regarding my sigmoidoscopy. I have a scope scheduled for Thursday next week and I feel hopeless trying to talk to the nurses via email. This is the brief summary of email exchanges. 

(also, please don't bother explaining to me that ""oral prep is so unnecessary and exhausting for a sigmoidoscopy!"" and that ""the enema they do there really isn't that bad! You're just being dramatic!"" I've heard enough of it and honestly it doesn't make me feel any better. I really won't magically just let go of all my medical+s*xual trauma all of a sudden and be totally fine with it.)

------
1) I had received my appointment letter, which also informed me that I would either get an oral prep prescription or an enema would be done before my procedure the day of. 
I first tried to communicate to them that I don't want an enema at all and if they could send me a prescription to my pharmacy for an oral laxative I could drink. 

They later responded saying they will not be doing that and I will have the enema done at the hospital before the procedure instead. 

------
2) I told them that I absolutely am not comfortable with that and could they please either send a prescription for an enema for me to do at home or the oral laxative drink. 

They replied that they will send it to my pharmacy. 

------
3) I thanked them and apologised for being so pushy and explained that it's due to medical+s*xual trauma and that the procedure in itself is very distressing and that I would rather be able to do the prep myself at home. 

Their response: 
""I understand your problem.

I spoke to Dr XYZ regarding the bowel prep, and he said no need for prep.

You don’t need to worry about the prep and if you have any queries please ask the doctor when you come for the scope.""

No prescription was sent to the pharmacy in the end, and I felt really puzzled since I thought it would be harder for them to see the bowel walls, but I told them that I will eat a liquid only diet 2 and a half days before and fast from midnight the day of to make it as clear as possible down there for them. 

They said that that's a good plan, and we left it at that. 

------
4) My procedure ended up being moved due to alot of emergency scopes needing to be done, so I emailed the GI nurses after receiving my new scope date. I asked if the same plan we agreed on still applies for this new scope and I got this response back:

""Hi, 

I presumed that you had the scope as planned on that date.

The plan is the same, you follow whatever you were planning to do.

It will be more visible for the doctor if your bowel is empty."" 

I can't tell if this is worded to make me feel stupid for not wanting an enema, but I literally asked if I could either do the whole oral prep to flush my entire colon at home or do an enema in the comfort of my own home.

 I feel really afraid that theyre telling me that I'm fine with no prep, then I'll go in and they'll do it and get all pissed off with me that they can't see well or something, and need to schedule another scope to redo it. 

Should I ask my gp for a prescription for oral prep anyway? I'm so nervous about all this. 

Please let me know what that email means because I'm taking it really literally and to me they're being lightly passive aggressive there!

UlcerativeColitis,Doctor mentioned UC as an afterthought,"I (F38) have had lower abdominal pain for almost 4 years. 2 years ago it was determined that while my pain increases around my period, the pain isn’t gynaecological. CT showed polyps and severe constipation (I have had trouble all my life with constipation-so that state is kinda normal for me). It took 18 months to get a doctor to do a colonoscopy.

Despite completing the prep work (and passing clear liquid 6+ hours before my scope), my bowel wasn’t empty which affected being able to visualise everything. 2 large polyps were removed and deemed to be precancerous. And as a side note the doctor said I have UC-he said it very quick, and said it was likely due to overuse of laxatives (specifically senna).

I don’t take laxatives. Although I said this multiple times-the doctor clearly thought I was lying (and about the prep work too). He didn’t go into detail, but implied that stopping laxatives would resolve the issue on its own. 

Now that I am researching, I can’t find anything to support UC being caused by laxative use and that it is more serious than just some irritation.

My mother passed from colon cancer just before Christmas (as she had already had her appendix, uterus, and gall bladder removed-they looked at her bowel first). 

The surgeon who did my scope was most concerned that they suspected I didn’t actually do my bowel prep (despite me stating otherwise), and gave me the ‘if you don’t do any better than before, another scope will be a waste of time’. 

It will be another month until I can get a second scope done, and my pain is worsening. Having anything in my bladder causes cramps, and I have been constipated and had issues passing gas (I have also had issues having an orgasm for some time-it is like my uterus can’t contract to get to that really good part of the orgasm).

I have already been to multiple specialists who state that tests don’t show anything, but it seems that no one is even willing to actually look.

Has anyone else experienced this? Or similar? ",1cnzy65

Psoriasis,My psoriasis is healing!,"I’ve had terrible scalp psoriasis since the start of the pandemic. It’s also about the time I became incredibly stressed and anxious (I had lots of big life events going on: graduating college, the pandemic, moving across the country, getting my dream job then loosing my dream job to the pandemic, and then eventually working another job I hated). 

I’ve been super stressed the past year trying to leave my terrible job and my scalp has been getting worse the past few months (side note: I do not drink or do drugs, I’m vegetarian, I walk 20k steps a day, and workout 5 days a week so overall I live a healthy lifestyle). I even started loosing hair for the first time because I was picking so much due to my anxiety. 

Well, I finally got a new job that pays me a above a living wage and I got to quit my low paying job two weeks ago. As a treat to myself, I gave myself a two week “staycation” before the new job starts to just fully relax. 

And wouldn’t ya know it, my scalp is the best it’s been in 4 years. A patch I’ve had right behind my ear for 4 years is completely gone. I just keep touching my ear and can’t believe how smooth it is. I think after all these years and trying different diets, I’ve found that my trigger is just stress and anxiety. 

I workout a ton so I’m not sure how much more stress management I can do, but I’ll finally be able to afford therapy and possibly anxiety meds! It’ll be interesting to see what happens in the coming weeks and months. I’m hopeful things will keep getting better as long as the anxiety stays away.  ",1couwdr

Psoriasis,Another win for light therapy,"Just wanted to hop on and say I had the worst flare up of my life in the beginning of March - my spots covered maybe 80% of my body. This would be my second flare up, the initial one being almost 10 years ago after getting strep throat. 

I tried everything under the sun - countless supplements, creams (including steroids…never ever again), red light therapy, ointments, etc. and the spots just kept spreading. 

At my wits end I contacted my derm and started light therapy and within two weeks over 75% of my psoriasis is healed. All the places I didn’t apply steroid cream healed the fastest. 

I do want to mention that I had already been living an incredibly healthy lifestyle - zero sugar diet, active, rarely drank alcohol, etc.  

It is also beginning to warm up here so I’ve been getting a lot of sunlight. I hope this helps someone out there!

Psoriasis,Scalp Psoriasis and Epsom Salts.   A T.Y.  and a recommendation ,"Hello.  I have a couple of quarter or half dollar sized  patches of psoriasis on my knees shoulder and tailbone.

This was after two months of eating clean and not drinking, I lost a lot of weight but skin didn’t really improve much.

Finally bit the bullet and saw a derm after I had a bacterial infection on leg (cellulitis) which I’m pretty sure was caused by me using too many creams that peeled off layers of skin and something getting in there. Then walking around on it a lot at work and making it worse.

I don’t have insurance, she gave me a sample foam, two tiny samples of a steroid and the otezla starter-but she wrote a scrip for two generic creams (think one is steroid and one isn’t) that would’ve cost 900 dollars; but good rx got it down to 100 bucks oOP

I hope that’s what did the trick cuz I’m fine paying 100 a month for them.

Psoriasis,Holy Cow is right! GREEN JUICE?!?,"A few weeks ago my new hero u/wo-mann posted in this sub of her success with drinking a pretty basic green juice she makes once a day for 3 weeks. Big thanks to her for sharing! In reading her [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/comments/1c3hfg7/holy_cow_green_juice/) my skeptic brain was like, no way can it be that simple for me. My optimistic brain, was like but, what if... Regardless, I saw zero down side to try this, I need more fresh veggies in my diet anyway and I'll know quickly if it doesn't work so I won't waste a lot of time, effort or money if not.

I had zero expectations I would see much improvement in my psoriasis but I was frankly shocked and very pleasantly surprised at my results! All my little spots and scalp p are gone and my ride or die big spots are mostly smooth and now hyperpigmented. I have scalp, plaque and inverse. Even my hairstylist was like ""woah, i only see one patch"" on about day 12.

I started on 4/14/24  and went 21 days straight of drinking 16-24oz of juice in the morning. I changed nothing else. I ate everything I normally eat, I drank, I smoked. I didn't even moisturize most days (i live in a humid climate). I'm not a health nut or hater, but green juice (especially with kale) is the last type of juice I'd ever voluntarily drink. But I even came to like the taste of the juice, it's pretty balanced.  ALSO as another benefit, my face skin also looks better AND it's one of the best *hangover cures* I've ever encountered as well. lol

As you can see, I'm not totally clear, but my p is soooo much better then when I started. But I'm not going to lie, I feel (itchy) and see my p fighting back. So I'm not sure where this will end up. I am going to continue to drink the juice and see where this goes. I will update if anything major changes one way or another. I am going to order a specialty vitamin blood test though, as I'm shocked that just drinking this juice has had such a dramatic effect. so maybe there is something to u/wo-mann thinking it's just a deficit of certain vitamins.

Anyway, as we all know, no solution offers a cure or works the same on everyone, but I encourage anyone willing to blend up some veggies and fruit, to try it for at least 3 days and see if your p responds. I'm still a little dumbfounded it worked for me.

Here is the slightly modified recipe I used from the [OG post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/comments/1c3hfg7/holy_cow_green_juice/)

Green Juice —

* 1/2 lemon (peeled \\\~ 60g / 2oz)
* 1/2 Apple (I use Granny Smith \\\~ 130 g 4-5 oz)
* 3 large celery stalks ( \\\~ 220 g /7-8oz)
* 1/2 large cucumber (\\\~ 225 g / 7-8 oz) 
* 4 oz kale (\\\~ 120g I used 1/3 of 12oz bag)
* 3/4 tbsp honey (\\\~17g  I added this to balance out the flavor, it does not make the juice sweet (i don't like sweet). If you use a sweeter apple, the honey may not be necessary )
* 8 oz water for easier blending

Blend everything in a blender. I used the smoothie setting. Yields appx 24 oz of juice when blended then pressed through a fine sieve, cheesecloth or a nut milk bag (i bought a set from amazon just for this). I have no patience for cleaning and using my juicer on a daily basis so I just used my blender.

Sorry for the novel. But just wanted to share as many details. Hope this helps others like it helps me and thank you again to u/wo-mann for posting!

Now this isn't necessary to read, but a postscript on my background with p as I always wish people would share more about their situation when they post the more holistic things that have helped. So as brief as I can.. I had my first major flare and diagnosis at 26 (ironically after a month on the atkins diet aka keto) and am now 48. My father and his mother had mild p, so it's definitely genetic in my case. I tried a lot of alternative options especially when I was first diagnosed, not many helped.  I've always responded to sunlight, light therapy, topical steriods. I've never had more than 65% coverage and would say I average around 40%. My upper body and left side of my body is more effected then my lower or right side. I'm average height, weight and don't have any allergies or any other medical conditions. I don't take any daily meds, vitamins or supplements currently. I have built a career in fine dining and wine, so altering my diet greatly is just a no go and would take away much of my joy, passion and reason for living. I eat a rich but relatively balanced diet of mostly non processed food, and I definitely enjoy carbs, dairy and nightshades. But raw fruits and veggies are a minority in my diet. ",1cnfskb
Psoriasis,Newly diagnosed firefighter ,"Hello Psoriasis community I’ve been reading everything on this subreddit for the last 24 hours and yall have such a great mindset about the condition. The first silver lining I’ve noticed about the diagnosis is that I’m with great company.

 I’m a 24 year old male firefighter. I work in California and it’s super busy in the summer we get absolutely beat up on wildland fires but we also wake up in the middle of the night for medicals and vehicle accidents and everything else. It’s very busy, sometimes stressful, and I freaking love it. Yesterday I got diagnosed with genital Psoriasis. It’s just a small patch that won’t go away it hasn’t spread or anything. I’m obviously super worried about this threatening my career especially with the chances of developing the PsA stuff (which seems to be higher if you have it on your genitals for some dumb reason).

 The way I see it is with luck, I have 10 years before the arthritis might get me. I might try to get on biologics to keep my symptoms from getting worse and I’m just gonna work my ass off as a firefighter in the meantime. To hedge my bets I’m going to finish my BA degree or get more professional certifications that could qualify me for less physically stressful jobs as a backup plan. If you have read this far thank you and do you think this is a good plan? Anyone else work in a similar field and have advice for me? ",1cnch4c

There is also a layer of white dead cells (I assume they are dead cells) on the rash and wrinkles/creases in the skin. I don't know why this is happening because the razor I used was clean.

eczema,Three Years Eczema-Free,"I had eczema from the time I was born up until I was 24. Three years ago, I had the worst flareup I've ever had in my life. My whole body was covered in eczema. I was waking up with blood on my pillow because the back of my ears had literally cracked open, and I could no longer put on lotion without feeling like I was having a chemical burn. 

A family friend of mine recommended that I cut out synthetic fragrances, and to my surprise (because I already didn't have that many fragranced products), it completely cleared up my eczema. 

It has been life-changing in the truest sense of the word. Sometimes I just marvel at the fact I'm no longer in constant discomfort. I know that my eczema could always come back, but right now I'm just grateful. I had tried everything and such a small switch made a world of difference.

I know many (if not most) of you have already militantly cut out all fragrances, but if you haven't, it might be something to consider.

eczema,Eczema fix ,"Hello I have dealt with eczema on my face since middle school. It got so bad I didn’t want to go to school anymore I went online. I’ve finally found a routine that helps and I wanted to share in case anyone is having trouble. I’m now 21 and this routine does wonders for me it usually goes away within 4-5 days depending how bad it is 

First if I have a flair up I use only vanicream products. The bar soap or liquid soap work both amazingly but I do prefer the bar soap. I don’t dry my face or body at all I leave it wet then I use the vanicream moisturizing lotion. Doing this well help lock in moisture and help soothe any itchiness or burning. You can put vaseline on top to lock the moisture even more. I do this about 3 times a day. 
(Wash your face or body with cold water ONLY if you want to soothe the pain. I noticed it also helps it go away faster) 

I literally don’t have to go to the doctor anymore crying and begging for more steroid creams to help. This routine is perfect! I genuinely hope this helps people because I know how hard it is to deal with eczema and you’re not alone you will get through it and you are so strong for dealing with this 💖

eczema,Clobetasol not clearing it fully,"I had a reaction to some stupid spray I used 3 months ago ish, I used it 8 times because I had a delayed reaction so I got a bad rash, was dxd with contact dermatitis/eczema.

I was given 2 big tunes of clobetasol and told to use it for 2 weeks. This is day 8 and I *still* see red spots, especially after I get out of the shower. Extra red, itchy, and burny, on the worse foot (rashes on the top of my feet if that matters) in the morning and *miserable* after any kind of running around.

This just really sucks because the next thing would probably be prednisone but I don't wanna have to wait 2 months for a derm appointment and urgent care doesn't work out well because the rash isn't super visible when it's not inflamed and I have raynauds so basically every doctors appointment just goes ""Wow did you know your feet are purple?"".

eczema,Zoryve foam has become my miracle cure (but crossing fingers lol),"My dermatologist prescribed Zoryve foam for my seborrheic dermatitis (scalp) which got so bad out of nowhere that it started causing hair loss. He was really excited to prescribe it to me but didnt even mention I could apply it anywhere for eczema. When i got home I googled the medication and found out it is also used for eczema. I started applying it to my recurrent patches and YALL. My eczema is gone. I am in disbelief. It doesn't provide instant relief like a steroid but jfc it worked for me. Within a week all my patches were gone and havent returned. I only apply it like once a week now and it has been keeping it totally at bay. Hopefully it continues to work, but I was having some of the worst outbreaks of my adult life in March/April and now I have zero active patches. 

I went home and saw my mom and she was so shocked to see me without any patches at all. she said it reminded her of a medication she tried when I was a child, sometime around 2002 maybe, which is the only other medication which completely cured my eczema but then it got recalled. Curious if anybody knows any drawbacks to Zoryve cause it seems too good to be true. Is there any way I could get some sort of withdrawal effect or negative side effects? 

 that being said, definitely ask your derm about it!!

eczema,Not even sure if it's even eczema in my ear canals ,"Howdy, first time posting to reddit so bare with me 😅

I might have eczema or psoriasis or both in my ear canals, accoring to my dermatologist. I've had similar flare ups in other areas on occasion, but over the last 6 or 7 years it's been nearly constant flare ups in one or both ears. 

Whatever it is, I'm more interested in the symptoms than a perfectly fitting diagnosis, I am wondering if anyone else has experienced anything similar as most of the information I am given makes more sense for skin I can readily see and reach. 

Are there any ear specific suggestions, because even applying lotion to my ears is harrowing. I can't really reach where it actually is. I have some kind of infection almost constantly and I am concerned my hearing will be or already has been impacted. 

All help would be appreciated. Happy to provide additional info, just trying to get these initial questions out.

To recap:
1) Does anyone else experience eczema in their inner ear?
2) Is there any ear related guidance that works  for others?

eczema,Duxipent / rinvoq,Hi all have been on rinvoq since July last year and has been an absolute life saver and has allowed me to have my life back. The only thing is I’m terrified of becoming resistant to it and occasionally get a little patch of eczema and I freak out thinking I’m going to have to go back to how things were previous. I tried many of the immunosuppressants that were on offer before rinvoq became available to me and they all failed and even ended up giving me kidney failure at one point which is now CKD stage 2. Basically I’m so “traumatised” from all past experiences with debilitating eczema I feel like it could go back at any moment .

eczema,Lips Eczema? Yellow crust? Infections? *long post*,"\*warning\*- gross pictures

Hi guys, I'm F(30)-no prior history of eczema. The only person that has eczema in my entire family is 1 cousin (but he is doing a lot better now), none of my immediate family members have skin issues. I live in cold and dry weather country. I have chronic dry lips my whole life (and also dandruff-not sure if relevant), but started to seriously address the problem last winter December by applying Vasaline to treat it. Around the same time, I tried using more lipsticks and introduce some new cosmetic/skin care products to my routine. I also only been using SLS free toothpaste since forever. At the around the same time I developed these red itchy rashes on my chest and collarbone (which I dismissed as heat rashes as I was vacationing in a hot and humid country). 

[https://ibb.co/NyC9Pfv](https://ibb.co/NyC9Pfv)

Then things went south, my lips started to cracked, bleed and the skin area around my lips started to peel and I couldn't open my mouth too wide because it would hurt-that was December. When they are not peeling, they were red and inflamed and sometimes I felt they oozed liquid.

[https://ibb.co/sQMPxvC](https://ibb.co/sQMPxvC)

[https://ibb.co/kgK2vP2](https://ibb.co/kgK2vP2)

I went to 3 different dermatologists who said different things like Cheilitis or Eczema or contact derma and prescribed me with steroid or hydrocortisone cream and some oral meds. It treated the red and inflamed symptoms and treated the dry and cracked skin around my lips. But my lips was still very dry. 

[https://ibb.co/B26dpKr](https://ibb.co/B26dpKr)

But the problem was once I'm off the med and the cream, it came back immediately the day after stopping them. 

[https://ibb.co/PQPF5qC](https://ibb.co/PQPF5qC)

After I returned from my vacation, which was now Ferbuary 2024, i went to a local doctor and was prescribed with a mix of fucidin 2% and clottimazole 1%. During this time, I noticed I may have allergy to beewax (reaction immediately the day after using DermaTherapy and Avene Cica). 

My lips were crusty, peeling and gross but the redness seemed gone. 

[https://ibb.co/7N1rbjn](https://ibb.co/7N1rbjn)

I stopped the cream after 7 days and symptoms got better. I only use Vasaline from then on. 

During March, I have these recurring flare up, just look red and puffy with these red dots on the lips. These got better throughout the day. 

[https://ibb.co/SQVJJfx](https://ibb.co/SQVJJfx)

My best month would be end of March to end of April, where asides from white flaky patches around my lips (which was almost unnoticeable). The skin rashes on my chest flare up occasionally which I observed it would worsen just before my period. 

[https://ibb.co/71c6czQ](https://ibb.co/71c6czQ)

[https://ibb.co/Cz76ZW9](https://ibb.co/Cz76ZW9)

Then came May, my lips flared up again and this time, it came back for the first time since January with yellow crust that seems to form at night when I went to bed. At the same time, my chest rashes is acting up as well (and seems like it is spreading??) 

\*gross warning\* 

[https://ibb.co/YWQ3V4f](https://ibb.co/YWQ3V4f) 

At this point, i'm not sure what is going on with my lips anymore, it's been 6 months and seem like nothing works. It came and go but never healed. I'm keeping a food journal. Does anyone have similar problems and can advise what I should do? I'm trying to get a derm referral, but considering this would be my 4th derm appointment, I'm not sure if they can help anymore and i'm afraid of steroid cream, since I feel like it thinning my lips a lot. 

Current chest rashes:

eczema,eczema or infected???,"reposting from r/medical in case anyone here can help 🥺🥺

hey all, sorry in advance bc this is pretty gross!! In the past 6 months I have had three pretty nasty flare ups of the eczema on my hands. All three times the general practice doctors I went to told me it was an infection and gave me antibiotics. None of the times did these help, it got so bad the first time (November) that a walk in doctor sent me to the ER with a note marked URGENT bc I needed antibiotics in an IV but when I got there their dermatologist took one look and said nah that's not infected you need steroids.

so I got Prednisone tablets and that cleared it up. The second flare up, almost the exact same story. By the third I vouched for myself and asked for the Prednisone from the start even when the walk in GP said it was an infection. Yesterday I saw my own doctor and showed her the wounds I was concerned about, and she said it's infected and gave me antibiotics. I'm stressed out that it's just gonna be the same thing all over again, but then again every ""flare"" presents a little differently so maybe it really is just infected this time???? my arm/ elbow is also affected, which has not happened before.

there are so many unknowns involved here like what's the trigger and why has this suddenly become chronic when it had never happened before November, etc etc, but right now I really just need to know if I should try to get some Prednisone or if antibiotics will actually help this time?? (ps- I'm super anxious about looking like that person who just wants a specific drug, and I don't WANT to be on steroids for any length of time bc I know they're hard on you but it's the only thing that's worked so far)

I also have a handful of steroid creams that are sometimes marginally effective but my doctor told me to not use those while on the antibiotics so I'm just,,, feeling very lost 

I'm fully aware this isn't the place for absolute answers but I'm just hoping it can reach someone who has maybe some experience with this and maybe I can feel less confused and alone about the whole thing 

thank you so much to anyone who read this whole thing!!! I appreciate you!",1cozj72

eczema,Need guidance on recent bout of eczema,"DW (50f, 5'-0"", 110lbs) started having eczema around her neck and jaw line about a month ago. We can't seem to find the trigger, and I'm hoping to put a game plan together to help her find relief.

Background: She is a breast cancer survivor, diagnosed in 2015, and cancer-free in late-2016 after 8 rounds of chemo and double mastectomy with implants. Since 2016 DW has been experiencing a myriad of nagging symptoms including tension headaches, tinnitus, fatigue, brain fog and generalized anxiety.

Lifestyle: She generally has a clean diet including fruits and vegetables, oatmeal and berries or green juice for breakfast, very little red meat, no caffeine or alcohol. She exercises two days a week and takes a 3-mile walk 3 times a week. She uses clean products for personal care and around the house (fragrance free soap, detergent, etc). Works two days a week as a recovery nurse. Sleeps about 7 hours a night when not disturbed by tension headaches. Drinks a liter of warm water with lemon and salt every morning and total of 3.5 liters of water per day.

Environment: Single family home with hardwood flooring on the first floor and medium pile carpeting on the second floor. \[Mold possibility\] We had a leak in the roof in 2017 that left visible water marks on the vaulted ceiling drywall. The roof was replaced within a month, and we painted over the water marks. We also had some water infiltration around our tub surround for the last few of years. I recently demolished the master bath in preparation for a remodel, but I didn't find any evidence of mold. I cleaned and scrubbed the studs just in case.

Medical: Labs have been fairly normal since 2017...no clear signs of anything nefarious. Early on, doctors blamed symptoms on chemo and peri-menopause. Tried a bunch of therapies like acupuncture, chiropractic, and lymphatic drainage massage with very short-term relief. Saw a nutritionist get gut health in order. Learned about Breast Implant Illness and removed the silicone implants in 2023. Symptoms persist. Last six months she has experiencing feelings of dehydration (always thirsty, barely perspires during workouts, dry skin). Now feeling inflammation on her face along with the eczema.

I feel so bad for her, and I'm really trying to help find some answers. Doctors just can't find anything wrong with her, and the internet is full of specialists who think it's mold or adrenal fatigue or parasites or biotoxins or gut dysbiosis or a combination of things or something else completely...it's all so disheartening, frightening and confusing. We've done a couple of air tests for mold, and the first result showed a colorful array of molds...the second came back nearly blank.

What's a reasonable game plan from here? We want to do allergy testing, but functional medicine community says that we need to fix the ""root cause"" before doing this. Anyone have a similar story? Or suggestions? Please help.",1coxkw7
eczema,Update: BYE ECZEMA,"Little update:
I finally found my holy grail to control my weeping eczema that was constantly getting infected. Skin has never felt better and I'm officially back to normal.

Context:
I was suffering from weeping eczema and was officially diagnosed in 2019 (thats 5 goddamn years) and it got to a point where I would avoid going out as it hurt each time I move (dried up wounds / cracked skin / open wounds). I have been to so many different dermatologists but all they gave me was antihistamines and random ass creams that dont even work. I got a whole cupboard filled with creams that dont work.

Earlier this year, I went to a dermatologist and he proposed a last ditch attempt for me. He prescribed me with prednisolone and some antibiotic creams. Lo and behold, my eczema cleared up within a week with no residue but upon researching more, I realised that prednisolone was actually harmful if I were to continue taking it long-term. 

(Posted a subreddit about this previously)

The moment I tapered off my prednisolone, my eczema returned and was flaring up to a whole new level. I had blood stains everywhere on my bed and I was actually helpless. 

However, up until a week ago, I saw a subreddit post where someone was treating their eczema by targeting the Staph instead of trying to treat it for the way it is.

I started testing out different products that were capable of clearing the Staph and I came across a cream called Mupider. I have been applying this cream once a day (at night, right after bathing) and it has totally eased up my eczema (close to no itch). My wounds would close very quickly and the dead skin around it would just peel off on its own.

Best part is - it doesnt hurt when I rub it across my open wounds. My biggest tip to controlling your eczema would be to keep a healthy lifestyle and take an allergen test to figure out your possible triggers. Mupider has been my holy grail and I will swear by it. However, this cream requires a prescription in my country so do check it out before heading to the pharmacy :)

And yes, if any of you have any doubts, feel free to ask me.

eczema,Do I get a TSW? Need an advice,"Hello, community, first of all I want to thank everyone here who write their advices and support! I have a question how to understand if you have tsw or just your regular eczema?   
My context, my eczema was moderate and mild before 2022, basically just neck during winter, some patches on arms. I used for this occasions dermovate (don't ask why I choose such strong steroid, in my country steroids are without prescription)   
  
After 2022 (I had HUGE trauma, i think it was my trigger) my eczema expand to face, legs, shoulders and become 24/7. For last 2 years my eczema didn't get better. I used dermovate but after learning in 2022 about TSW I reduced using steroid to once a 1-2 week. I never applied steroid for 1 week, it was usually just 1-2 day until skin gets better.   
  
After learning about TSW I switched to hydrocortisone which also helped me. Then I tried protopic and thought that it is my saviour but my skin become worse.   
All in all I decided to stop using steroids even if they still helps me. It's been a week and my skin just looks like previous bad eczema.   
  
Now I don't understand if I need to leave my skin alone to deal with TSW (and use just thing as no moister treatment) or to treat my eczema (dealing with trauma and stress) . ",1cowohp
eczema,Dupixent criteria (UK),"Hi, I’m currently at crisis point in my eczema journey and due to attend a long waited for dermatology appointment next week. I have been going through TSW for the past 6 months and really struggling. I’m really wanting to go on dupixent but have heard that it will only be considered if I have tried ciclosporin or methotrexate, which I’m really not keen on doing due to the side effects. Does anyone have any advice on how I’d be able to be considered for this at my dermatology appointment??

eczema,To Use Corticosteroids Or Not?,"I started getting eczema a few years ago. After a year or two I found that something in my diet (lime juice) was the cause or a major cause, after lots of trial and error I cut it out and it went away for over a year.

Before I learned what it was the only way I could get it to go away was with corticosteroids. Well, now I have no lime juice or anything acidic in my diet and it is back. Feels like this time it is here for the long haul.

  
How bad is it to use corticosteroids long term? Do you guys do it? Anyone who also has their eczema go away from corticosteroids find any other creams that also work that might not be so damaging?

  
Unfortunately I have this around my groin and bum, not a great place to be using anything that could be causing problems

On the other hand.... not a good place to feel a constant and severe itch

  
Any and all recommendations welcome (its OK, non doctors feel free to chime in, I'm not gonna run out and do something dumb cuz of what a stranger on a message board mentioned)

Thanks",1coosbg
eczema,I’m Tired. ,"RANT. Eczema is so physically and emotionally draining. I had my first flare in 2018, and it has only been getting worse. I’m affected on literally every part of my body. The worst areas are my face, chest, arms, hands, back, and calves. But in a bad flare I get it on my stomach, thighs, and fingers as well. And I’m so freaking tired. I’m tired of being so uncomfortable all the time. Im tired of having to explain myself to clients at work (vet tech). I’m tired of the sympathetic looks people give me in a bad flare. I’m tired of going to specialists and not having answers. I just did allergy testing and got the food panel back- I’m allergic to all seven foods they tested for with soy being the worst. Soy is in everything. I’m mourning the possibility of a normal life. It shouldn’t be this hard to be alive. I have no social life because after a long day of suffering, all I want to do is sleep to ignore the itch. My relationship is suffering because I feel so ugly and disgusting, and any touch makes me itch more. Eczema has ruined my life. ",1co5uhs

i started suffering from tsw and then was prescribed different steroids that i have used up until a few months ago on & off. my tsw has lessened since 2020 but that year was a nightmare. the pandemic was my personal hell as my whole body was covered in rashes and skin flakes in my bed always.

the aftermath has caused me to have sensory issues to certain fabrics & i know i’m allergic to wool. the only trigger i can think of is the fact that i have a dog but he’s been in my house for about a year before the aggressive tsw started.

i have certain food allergies and they have been the same for most of my life. i have stuck to eating most of the same food for my whole life but i still suffer from flare ups every now and then.

eczema,Rubbing Alcohol on Eczema?!,"Okay, so this is purely anecdotal and I 100% know that what works for me will not work for everyone - bc bodies are weird and complicated, and sometimes, jerky things. 

So, I was gifted with my first bout of eczema 10 years ago…and the little bugger disappeared for the most part for about 8 years…until it decided to rear its head in full force about 2 years ago. And for the last 2 years, it’s been a near constant war with my body - eyelids, arms, hands, armpits, and most recently, ankles and shins. 

I’ve tried just about everything - steroid creams, change in diet (Altho, to be fair, I lost this battle before I could even really start it bc I had no idea WHERE to start…gluten, dairy, sugar, high histamine foods?! I had no idea what I was allowed to eat), salt baths…nothing really worked. 

The only thing that I could figure out was that I seemed to be part of a minority where my eczema flares up when there’s more moisture in the air and when it’s hot (even more so when my skin comes into contact with direct sun light for any length of time).

Once I figured out that being “moist” wasn’t helping and was actually making things worse, I stopped following the advice of slathering on the lotions and moisturizers and Vaselines. Last year, I had horrible eyelid eczema and I was really freaking miserable. The only thing that eventually broke my misery was when I stopped putting lotion on my eyes and I completely dried them out. And magically…the freaking eczema slowly, but surely, went away?! 

Now, fast forward to now (spring time), with the onset of warmer and moister (…”moist”…shudder) temps, my legs and arms are covered in eczema again. And once again, I resorted to slathering on the lotion…until finally, my mom yelled at me and insisted I put alcohol on all my itchy spots (she’s an old Asian mom who thinks that rubbing alcohol can cure everything. You gotta cut? Put some rubbing alcohol on it! Broke your nose? Slap some rubbing alcohol on it! Boyfriend cheated on you? Drown him in rubbing alcohol. You get the point). So, I caved and put rubbing alcohol on my itchy parts (mostly to shut her up). And then a really magical, albeit annoying thing happened, my eczema started to go away almost immediately. As in, 12 hours later, the itchy red papules were shrinking and disappearing. It’s been 24 hours and my shins almost look normal again. 

First, wtf? 

Secondly, why is alcohol working?! I mean, maybe I just had a bacterial or fungal thing going on? But even so, wow? Also, given that there’s some new research connecting eczema to staph bacteria on your skin…maybe it was indeed just a bacterial thing? 

Third, I absolutely did not tell my mom that it worked bc she can never know she was right about something for once. I’ll never hear the end of it. 

Finally, again, this was just my experience but I wanted to share just in case there might be other really miserable people who get heat/humidity-induced eczema. To them, I want to say - maybe try drying it out…or if you have a rash that isn’t on your face (and not bloody or with open sores), maybe try rubbing alcohol?! 

Good luck to everyone! Also, don’t try rubbing alcohol if lotions actually give you relief and they don’t make you itchier!! ",1cohtkz
eczema,Hives and eczema,"Hey all, I have suffered from mild eczema for 15 years on and off. I was constantly using a low amount of steroids over this period, maybe going through 1-2 30gram tubes of 1% dermaid a year.
A year ago all hell broke loose and I had full body flares which had never happened and I believe it was triggered from going in my mates spa/pool that seemed to have a lot of chlorine. I then used the dermaid heavily to get it under control but it seemed to only stop the problem for a few days before coming back. I then did some research and convinced myself I had TSW and went cold turkey. 
This was 8 months ago and my skin got very bad for the first 4 months before starting to show signs of healing. It is now probably the best it has been in over a decade (though I skin on the inside of my elbows is only a few scratches away from breaking),though I have seemed to develop hives when ever I sweat from working out. This has never happened before and started around the same time my skin was really healing up. I even broke out in full body hives just from taking the dog for a walk before haha. 
I am wanting to know if anyone has experienced this or what your opinion is on my situation. Could it be just a phase of me stoping the use of steroids? If you have a similar story or experience please let me know. Thank you!

Allergies,Allergic to nearly all food all of the sudden,"My wife (f38) recently became allergic to all of the 8 major food allergens (milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, and soybeans). There is an additional long list of other foods and environmental allergens as well. 

She was always allergic to outside allergens, and it was never much of a concern. The food allergies seemingly came overnight and aside from shellfish, were non-existent. 

Several visits with an allergist confirmed hundreds of IgG reactions, some symptomless or weak reactions, and others with varying effects. For instance, corn will cause skin rashes that split open over the course of a few weeks after exposure. Soy, pork and sesame will cause stomach ache and dry heaving approximately 6 hours after. Wheat causes a mild body rash that lasts a day or so. Last night a previously unknown food allergen caused sinus itching and eye twitching.

The allergist said because the reactions didn't occur within the hour, it's not an allergy, but urticaria. From my understanding, urticaria is essentially allergies with a different make. She was prescribed antihistamines to take daily and told to avoid all triggers. And that was pretty much it which is why I'm writing. 

Has anyone ever had this happen before? Is it a sign of another problem? The allergist just shrugged it off and said sometimes allergies pop up like this. Maybe they'll go away on their own

It's extraordinarily difficult to avoid all the trigger foods. What does long term, small but constant exposure do to your body, health, etc? The allergist said there will be systemic inflammation, and said to increase the dose of antihistamines. 

Taking massive doses of antihistamines daily is not ideal, although I am not seeing alternatives. Might there be others?",1coxyyf

Allergies,Help - Confirmed Egg Allergy at 41 Years Old,"Hi! I have a newly confirmed egg allergy that came out of nowhere a couple months ago at age 41.  No food or any type of allergies ever in my life, so this is a surprise and frustrating.  First, I have a ton of respect for what you allergy sufferers go through now.  I knew before that it must be a pain to deal with it, but I didn't REALLY know how hard it can be.  So my question is, eggs have always been a big part of my diet.  I relied on them for a quick, healthy protein.  I don't eat seafood at all, so that's out to replace the protein.  What do you guys do to replace egg in your diets?  Any excellent websites you can point me to for egg-free recipes?  Ideas on what you do for breakfasts where eggs were always a main breakfast for me?  Much thanks in advance!",1copznk

I HAVE been tested for this allergy by skin test and blood test, both came back with no reaction to sample.  
My symptoms are weird and my allergist has not  seen this happen before.

I react to one brand of salmon, its freshly frozen salmon from Butchers box (online delievery service). Ive eaten sushi salmon, various ones from the supermarket without issue

My reaction is not instant, if I eat this salmon for dinner, I wake up in the morning 9hrs later with my tongue slightly swollen. Its enough that talking feels weird and people can notice.   I woke up lastnight and noticed at 3am that my tongue had swollen.  I had also taken allergy meds with no help at all.   


So hivemind, please help my allergist out with any suggestions on what I might be allergic to so we can test it???

I eat tuna, canned and fresh just fine, Cod and trout as well.  This brand of salmon is the only thing I react to now, I have no other allergies. I do have intolerance to soy and lactose.

I have eaten JUST this salmon and nothing else for dinner one time and reacted so its 100% the salmon. ",1co0058

I have some mild post nasal drip issues - I'm not allergic to any one thing - I've had the test and it came back 100% negative.  I manage them through nasal rinse before and after bed.  Mostly after.

My biggest allergy issue is a chronic dry/sore throat.  In recent years, I've done a better job of managing it through the use of xylimelts (overnight) and dry mouth mints (during the day).

Three weeks ago I started a new job and there is something about the water here that is aggravating my throat.  It's filtered, UV, reverse osmosis ... blah blah blah but something is triggering my throat and I feel it the most after I drink of cup of water and yes I have tried different cups - that doesn't make a difference.

What's the solve here?  Distilled water?  Trying to figure out how to manage this.

My aunt says she wants me to prove that I'm using my inhaler correctly which is bullshit. I already know how to use it. I got sent home with nebulizer treatment and steroids. 

1. Ideally, have a chamber, shake the inhaler
2. Exhale
3. Make sure inhaler and chamber/spacer aren't jammed 
4. Press down on the inhaler 
5. Inhale slowly 
6. Hold your breath as long as it's comfortable/ 30 seconds. 
7. Repeat after a minute if necessary. (Two total puffs if needed).

Asthma,This is too funny,I am yet again struggling with asthma. I was on a google spree when i came across this Google Question. So i click on the answer not really expecting anything and the first thing here is: shake the puffer Lol. My first thought was so like a conditioned response? Shaking the puffer = comfort. Basically like a childrens lullaby: dont worry heres the shaker. I laughed out loud. Maybe my humour is broken due to this being the fourth day im wheezing and coughing non stop and i mean literally non stop and the spray makes it easier to breath but not completely and then only for like 3 minutes before i get crushed by an invisible elefant on my chest again,1co8ane

Asthma,Where can I order an inhaler online?,"My soon to be husband, is almost out of his back up inhaler (albuterol). He doesn’t have insurance at the moment, his jobs insurance is out of this world expensive!! He has an asthma attack every other day lately, and I’m worried he’s going to run out. If he goes to a dr right now it’ll cost him almost $300 for a first time consult at a local dr, plus the price of the inhaler. Which I’m told is currently around $300-400?!? 🤦‍♀️ I was laid off and now he’s the only one supporting a family of 4, with his two kids in another household. We just can’t afford it!! Any advice would be appreciated, comment or dm. Thanks in advance for the help :) god bless and have a great day…",1cono6x
Asthma,Anyone have any experience with Dulera/Zenhale?,"I stabilized my asthma with atm ivory initially but it wore off by the 9th hour, so I was switched to Dulera/Zenhale to try.

At first I felt it was great and I got prescriptions filled for it, but after a couple weeks started needing my rescue inhaler more and more and now I feel (1.5months later) I feel like it doesn’t do anything…

Is this just me or should I wait longer? Has anyone else had this issue?
Does this mean it doesn’t work for me or is there another possibility?
 Any input is super appreciated",1cohq9v
Asthma,States fluctuating and having severe tiredness ,my symptoms are not severe like I’m blue in the face but my oxegyn isn’t too great and I’m tired and I get dizzy but my breathing is alright but I do become symptomatic . and there’s still definitely inflammation going in . When I take my prevention inhalers my chest still hurts so I’m still recovering . my specialist isn’t freaking out but if I have concerns I should speak to my family doc which I’m thinking I should . My asthma is very sensitive to triggers and I guess I been really sensitive lately which I guess means the low oxegyn . I’ve had episodes where my lung function has dropped quickly . part of me is super anxious too cause I just came out of hospital not even a week ago and this is my 2nd hospital trip in 7 months ,1comje7
Asthma,VCD or Asthma messing up?,So… I’ve been kinda freaking out because my asthma has been out of control lately not responding to treatments. I  mentioned that in a group and somebody said to check for VCD. I looked into that and it’s no treatment 😭 I’d basically have to live with the panic hyperventilating can’t catch my breath wheezing feeling forever?? Omg…. I rather die. I’m scared.

Asthma,Smoking neighbors (apartment),"I live in a group of 6 apartments on the top floor. All of the units  adjacent to mine smoke cigarettes. The neighbor below me and next to me smoke in their homes, while the neighbor to the other side of me smokes on the steps by our doors. Both my cat and I have asthma, and both of our asthmas have gotten considerably worse since moving in last year. We have about one more year left on the lease, but these people own their condos, while we are just renting it from our landlord. Any tips on what to do? It’s really the neighbor who smokes inside next to my apartment that is causing the most issue, as we can smell it in the bedroom especially when he is smoking, and it often causes an uptick in symptoms. Thank you for reading this far 🙏🏻",1cof2j3
Asthma,Does this sound like asthma?,"I can't breathe when laying down in any position and it keeps me up at night. During this I also feel something like air bubbles in my lungs. Sometimes I also can't breathe during the day but that's less common (it's worse at night).

Asthma,Methacholine Challenge Madness. What do you think? ,"Hello! 

I was diagnosed with mild asthma in 1997 when I was 16. At the time, the doc said I was clearly asthmatic, but was amazed by my lung capacity. At the time I was doing swim club 4 nights a week. 
I took QVAR from about '99 onwards, and ventilin.  Classic asthma symptoms, allergies etc etc. Under control mostly after being put on inhalers. 

Fast forward to 2023. I am now in my 40s, and suddenly QVAR ain't cutting it any more. Shortness of breath, wheezing. I am referred to a pulmonolgist. He puts me on Zenhale, and sends me for a chest X Ray and a methacholine challenge. 

Zenhale helps a lot. But I am still wheezy.  

So here's the fun bit. Chest X Ray comes back clear. I pass the Methacholine challenge. I feel like I'm dying through the whole thing. I feel wheezy and faint and have to take a puffer afterwards. 

My pulmonologist is STUMPED. He sends me for a retry at another hospital. I pass again! No asthma! 

Has anyone else had this happen? I thought it was impossible to do this test if you have asthma. He is sure I have asthma. I am sure I have asthma! I felt like I was unable to get air in or out during the test, so something was going on. 

Now I'm meant to be on the list for some kind of sputum test.... so we'll see. 

Thanks for your insights! ",1cocim4

Asthma,Antihistamines and dry cough,"- im under control with a pulmo and gp and I have a spinal disease -

I was sick at christmas. Highly likely it was pertussis. Now my asthma and allergies are out of control. I recognize a asthma coughing fit and a pertussis fit. 

Pulmo gave me last week:
Singulair
Seebri (glycopyrronium inhaler)
Up the dose of zyrtec

I felt great for 4 days, I thought my phlegmy cough was gruadually fading away. But it turned out the loose phlegm became THICK and now I have mucus plugs that nearly choke me. Guaifenesin makes it a bit more loose, as well as my inhalers and nebulizers.

Asthma,Weakness after increasing meds,"Hi!
I(36F)'ve been diagnosed for 24 years, during that time asthma was sometimes controlled, sometimes not so much. My asthma is allergic, the main allergen is cat fur. Lately I started immunotherapy and found a great alergologist, who looked at my spirometry and said ""whoa, girl, we need to get this under control"". So, she quadrupled my formodual (everyday med) told me to take hitaxa in the morning and montelukast in the evening and a week ago added alvesco (morning and evening) since spirometry is still the same.
I feel awful. My head hurts, my hands shake, my heart beats like a drum (in a bad way) and I'm weak. Also my back hurts. 
Did anyone experience sth like this? Does it get better? I'm seeing her on Tuesday but I'm seriously thinking about stopping alvesco before that (things got worse when alvesco entered the scene; on the other hand the whole affair started three weeks ago, so it can be anything)

Those are pretty much a thing of the past for me but now since I’ve been diagnosed with asthma, any strong fragrances send me into a frenzy of not being able to breathe and not being able to take deep breaths around strong fragranced perfumes or lotions. I can’t even wear my own and I have a pretty big collection of both fragrances and lotions that I used to love. Anyways. I work at a beauty store and people are constantly spraying perfumes or applying lotions and now I can barely stand it. I take one whiff and it sends me into a panic mode bc it flares up my asthma.

Asthma,"Got asthma from covid in 2021, it only triggers at night now, what even is asthma and how do I move forward","I wasn't born with asthma, my covid just developed into asthma and I kept hoping it would go away but it's been 3 full years now and really looks like it's permanent. I don't have any of the long covid symptoms after about 6 months so I would not classify it as long covid, I just want people here to believe me.

At first I was gasping, wheezing, unable to breath until I threw up, truly miserable for like 6 months which is what led to the post covid asthma diagnosis. Then I was given some inhalers. throughout the day I used rescue inhaler and had a daily steroid inhaler. Things have improved from that and now my attacks are sporadic. The steroid really helped but had diminishing returns. 

However at night it's still horrible and I don't know what to do or push my doctor for. All I have is an albuderol rescue inhaler at this point. Almost every night around 8pm I start wheezing and then by the time I lay down in bed I'm in a full attack and can't sleep from coughing and chest tightness and the feeling of being unable to breath. I have already bought full allergen covers for all my pillows and wash religiously, as well as have a huge HEPA air filter in the bedroom. I don't know why it's mainly at night or what is triggering it

Is there anything at all I can do? Am I allergic to something in the bedroom? I do have cats, but I try to keep them out of the bedroom. I am just so lost and my doctor just acts like it's a normal long covid situation that I need to wait out, but at this point I think it's just *damage* from covid and permanent asthma. I would rather treat the asthma like it's asthma than keep hoping it'll go away because it likely won't ever.

 Should I push for an asthma specialist?? What kind of doctors do y'all see? Feel really crazy having ""new"" asthma as an adult that no one is taking seriously

Asthma,So beyond frustrated,"Just a rant/vent. I'm sure most people here can relate. 

I'm going through my second round of asthma/bronchitis in a month. Missing time from work. Choking on my congestion and the nebulizer/rescue inhaler/60mg of steroids don't seem to be helping. It hurts. My body is tired. I'm wearing a pad meant for bladder leaks due to forceful coughs. I have pulled muscles in my neck and chest. No amount of coughing is clearing my chest. 

I have cried and screamed. It brings back what I would claim to be trauma as a child. I had asthma so badly, I was in kindergarten with a trash bin next to me just coughing and throwing up all day. I remember the stares from classmates. My parents had me doing allergy shots and nebulizer treatments and all the medicines...but the one thing they would NOT do...was stop smoking near me. 

They smoked in the car, house...had to sit in smoking sections at restaurants. We had a one bathroom home which my mom would smoke in while getting ready, and I had to be in there getting ready too. Parties most weekends with everyone smoking inside. They knew I couldn't breathe. That I was suffering and begging constantly for them not to do it and I just couldn't get away from it. 

Sometimes I get so angry thinking about it. They set me up for this. I never had a chance. My whole childhood was consumed by it. It makes me feel like I wasn't important enough to be heard or considered. 

They're good people. I think at the time it was just so normal to smoke everywhere, they thought it was okay. Now they smoke outside only. It's just a little too late. ",1cn1vvw
Asthma,Workouts that will help my lungs as a severe asthmatic?,"My asthma is very sensitive. I usually have to be on steroids which really help me out especially during allergy season, but even with the aid of steroids I still have asthma attacks.

Asthma,"Got bumped down from Clenil 200 to Soprobec 100, struggling","Just a rant I guess. We've to A&E twice in one week last year, nothing allowed up on their tests, went to GP when I started to get wheezing at night and got prescribed a rescue inhaler and sent for spirometry. Well, apparently the test results disappeared into thin air. I got by on the blue inhaler, at least that was something, I was able to exercise safely. Then I couldn't get an NHS appointment and went to a private GP to ask if it was worth trying an asthma treatment. She said yes and put me on Clenil 200mcg. I could finally just *breathe!*

So that ran out and I went to my local GP since they changed their booking system and I was able to get an appointment this time, and I asked for a new prescription, and they Said no, reluctantly put me on Soprobec 100 and ordered a new spirometry test. Commented that it sounded like ""mild"" asthma, despite my A&E visits last year and in the past.

Well, Soprobec 100 mcg has been about as useful as a chocolate teapot. I'm tracking symptoms and it's just like before I was on any medication at all. After 2 weeks I've still not been given a date for the spirometry test. All notes from my A&E visits last year are also non-existent, not a trace of them showing on my NHS records.

I dug out my old Clenil and shook it like hell and squeezed out a dose from it this morning and soon felt noticeably better. Clenil and Soprobec are supposedly made with the same ingredients, but it's just like my contraceptive pill, I was randomly switched to a different brand one day years ago and it's been causing problems ever since, yet those are also made with identical ingredients. So the brand really does seem to make a difference.

Anyway, I'm stuck breathing poorly, unable to sing more than 10-15 minutes at a time so I can't take gigs anymore so less income, I can't exercise, it's hard to get to sleep some nights with the air hunger and wheeze, my quality of life is back to being kinda rubbish. But everything is waiting on this spirometry test which I will probably do really well at due to being a singer, and I'll have to fight to be taken seriously, just like I always do with the NHS.

Just really fed up of this whole mess.

# ANA tests

**Positive ANA does not equal lupus!** While more of a rule out screening (negative ANA = very unlikely to have SLE). Upwards of 15-20% of healthy individuals in the population at large will have a positive ANA. [Only about 10-15% of people who have a positive ANA will later be diagnosed with SLE](https://www.rheumatology.org/I-Am-A/Patient-Caregiver/Diseases-Conditions/Antinuclear-Antibodies-ANA).

# Tests used in diagnosing lupus

* **anti-dsDNA** \- anti-Double Strand DNA is sometimes automatically tested for, but may need to be ordered separately. This test, when highly positive (2-3 times max cut off at least) is almost exclusively seen in SLE. However, only about 30% of SLE patients have this antibody. It's great if it's there to confirm diagnosis, it does not rule out diagnosis if it is absent.
* **ENA Panel** \- Extractable Nuclear Antigen panel, usually automatically done if ANA comes back positive
* **anti-Sm** \- Anti-Smith. Typically included in the ENA panel. This is another antibody, that when highly positive, almost always means SLE, but only about 25% of SLE patients have this antibody.
* **RNP** \- Anti-Ribonucleoprotein. Typically included in the ENA panel
* **anti-chromatin** \- Anti-chromatin is a relative newcomer in diagnostic testing for SLE and probably will NOT be ordered automatically. Its exact utility in diagnosis is still being determined.
* **Apl panel** \- Antiphospholipid Antibody Panel, which consists of 3 tests:
   * **LA** \- lupus anticoagulant
   * **aCL** \- anti-cardiolipin antibodies
   * **Anti-β2GP** \- anti-beta 2-glycoprotien antibodies
* **CBC** \- Complete Blood Count, some abnormalities in WBC, RBC and PLT counts can be significant.
* **CMP** \- Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, here the doctors are generally looking for kidney dysfunction (GFR, BUN/CR).
* **ESR** \- Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate, this is a nonspecific inflammation marker.
* **CRP**\- C-Reactive Protein, another nonspecific inflammation marker.
* **C3** \- Compliment C3
* **C4** \- Compliment C4
* **CH50** \- Compliments, Total, these are part of the compliment system, which is a tertiary part of the immune system.

Also, if you suspect you have a rash, getting a biopsy of it done at a dermatologist’s office can be helpful as the pathologist can identify histological evidence of lupus.

# Diagnostic Process

ACR Diagnostic Criteria on r/lupus [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/lupus/wiki/index/#wiki_what_are_the_diagnostic_criteria_for_sle.3F)

The rheumatologist/PCP will take a detailed history. I highly recommend writing down as many of your symptoms as possible, especially focusing on the symptoms you have that are in the American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria for lupus - see [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/lupus/wiki/index/#wiki_what_are_the_diagnostic_criteria_for_sle.3F) above.

Include all your symptoms, but I would make those at the top of the list. Write down how long they’ve been going on, anything that makes them better or worse, and how much they impact your life. Do they prevent you from dressing yourself, eating/cooking, bathing yourself, doing hobbies, meeting your obligations?

ANA varies from person to person and doesn’t necessarily correlate with disease activity. Anti-dsDNA is more indicative of disease activity and can be elevated prior to and during a flare. Symptoms can also come and go, and over time you may develop additional symptoms. If you scroll through the last week of posts or so, there are a few posts that will have pretty detailed answers to your questions from multiple community members so you can get a better sense of just how full on fickle lupus can be.

Here are some good posts, one is other people experiences in general, the others are rashes (warning: some are particularly severe):

lupus,"Lupus, fatigue, and exercise","Hi ... Iike many of us here, I have chronic fatigue. Lately, it's been getting worse. There's no indication from labs that I am deficient in vitamins B-complex and D, hemoglobin is OK, and my sleep is fine.

From all the reading I've been doing on the subject, the best remedy is **more exercise**. So I decided to go back to the gym for regular stamina and strength training, and external motivation support from trainers. I've not been back since Covid, and since I am taking strong immunosuppresants for lupus nephritis, I am feeling really anxious about it.

I plan to wear an N95 mask, and am dreading it because I know how uncomfortable it's going to be. The gym has a good ventilation system and disinfectant for wiping down equipment, which is reassuring,

lupus,almost done my prednisone..,"i was on prednisone for approximately 2.5 months and i had my last dose today. im so confused though. i thought i would be losing weight and having a decreased appetite as i get onto a lower dose considering i started on 100mg. dont get me wrong my appetite was out of control at the beginning too but i feel like it was a bit more manageable. my weight was about 130lbs pre treatment (which is just slightly higher than i'd like for me-with my height and stuff i feel pretty comfortable around 125-127lbs) but i didnt gain any weight until about 2-3 weeks ago. i had gained about 6 pounds in 1 week (which yes, could be worse but my appearance has been seriously altered)my friend told me she hardly recognized me and my face ID was having trouble recognizing me as well. my moonface is pretty bad and the fat distribution has been bad so it's hard to fit into my clothes properly. i didnt want to buy a whole new wardrobe since 1, i was planning on losing the weight anyway and 2, i knew the steroids were going to be only a few months of use. but in just the past 2 weeks ive gained a total of maybe 12 pounds or so. So yeah im just lost since people told me as i lower the dose things with weight and moonface would improve but it seems to be the opposite and i cant stop eating.

like i said, tomorrow will be my first day off steroids im not sure what to expect. i have already talked to my doctor about my weight concerns(the one whos overseen most of my care) and he says just eat well and exercise and im trying so hard ive been exercising every day but it doesn't mean anything if i cant stop myself from eating 5000 calories a day and constantly crave sweets. he said theres nothing we can do about it right now and he is also away for the next month. the soonest i can see the rheumatologist is in 3 months and also my diagnosis is new so its actually my first appointment with her besides meeting her when i was admitted to ER last month. i also have a thyroid disease and was told to speak to my endocrinologist since they also deal with metabolism and weight issues. but when i talked to her today she just said the same thing and she has no suggestions for me...im feeling really depressed and i just want to go back to looking like myself again. and get this hunger under control

lupus,Emcouraging Progress,"The last time I posted I was in the middle of a flare and completely beside myself with pain. My rheumatologist is on maternity leave and the rheumatologist covering phone service was VERY dismissive. I hated him. BUT he made arrangements for me to have an emergency appointment with another rheumatologist. This one started methotrexate and folic acid. At my regular follow-up (with another covering rheumatologist) we decided to continue the methotrexate at the current dose because I had only had 3 doses.

My current covering Rheumatologist informed me that Lupus flares don't break on their own, you have to intervene. So that first week I spent trying to thug it out was for naught.

Since I started the methotrexate, y'all, I feel so much better.

I am still in pain a lot, but it's much more tolerable. I am starting to get some of my functionality back. I started doing chair yoga. Going up steps isn't killing me. Going down steps still sucks. Knees have SO many design flaws.

We're probably going to increase my methotrexate at my next appointment. I am losing hair due to it but I don't give a fuck. Maybe I will shave my head and wear pink anime wigs.

Also, I got my medical card and have been to the dispensary. The budtenders are so helpful when it comes to picking out products specifically geared toward pain that have fewer psychoactive effects.

Some days are still better than others. I am going to continue taking it day by day.",1cp8lzh
lupus,First steroid taper advice,"Hey everyone, I recently posted about having hives potentially from hydroxy. It ended up expanding throughout my body and my dermatologist said it’s from the plaquenil so I have to stop it for now. I’m planning on restarting it in the desensitization technique after the steroids. I have been having a really tough go of it for the last few months so this failure on the medication is a bummer. I haven’t been able to work or keep up with really anything at all in my life and it’s making me depressed and stressed which is making everything worse. I’m a single mom and my daughter needs a functioning mom to keep a roof over our heads. I requested a steroid taper to see if that will help get me out of this flare. Thankfully, my rheum agreed and sent it in. Starting at 20mg and going down 5mg every five days. Does anyone have advice on how to handle the potential anxiety and mental health side effects? That’s what worries me the most. And the moon face 😭 it’s worth it for me to be able to take care of my family but any advice is appreciated! ",1cp2qpu

lupus,I FINALLY GRADUATING!,,1coad00
lupus,Have you been diagnosed with lupus enteritis? Does this sound like it?,"I'm 35F diagnosed with CLE since April 2023. In December I started throwing up every. single. morning. Usually just a bit of bile, but sometime in the first 30 minutes after I become vertical, I get stuck dry heaving for a minute or two and end up throwing up whatever little nothing is in my stomach after a night of sleep. 

In March I finally found a GP (took over 6 months to find someone who was both good and available for new patients, I was just seeing the dermatologist who diagnosed me last year before) and was directed to take omeprazole daily. That's been working to stop the vomiting but then they wanted to dial me down to prilosec (about half strength of omeprazole), which does not work and I was back to puking every morning. I'm back on the omeprazole now but it doesn't seem to be working as well as before, and I'm still nauseas every a.m. regardless of what I ate or how long I slept, though I don't puke every morning. 

It gets worse (more puke, longer sessions of heaving) if I'm stressed. I'm starting to wonder if this is lupus enteritis, but the descriptions I've found have been pretty vague and just say ""nausea and abdominal discomfort."" While I wait for my GP to respond (sent him about the same question), does anyone here have a definite LE diagnosis who can comment on if this seems similar?",1corxky

lupus,explaining fatigue to your partner,"How do I explain the difference between being tired and fatigue to my partner? 

Today i told him about the spoon theory and said “i have -5 spoons today” and he replied with “aka tired? Lol” 

I am indeed, ‘too tired’ to try to explain, so,  I replied with “yeah sure.” i know he *tries* to understand, he responded with “never heard of this so it’s new to me”

I just don’t know how to explain. Any insight would be helpful… 

TIA! ",1cob1b8
lupus,I Look ✨UH-MAY-JING✨🤌🏼,"Yesterday, I (27 F) finally got to leave the house and visit my family. I’ve been admitted to the hospital every month since this year started and I haven’t been able to work for the most part. I still didn’t feel well but I needed to see my family for my peace of mind.

They were all so happy to see me and are pleased with the fact that I have gained so much weight and I look amazing for someone who was literally in the hospital just over a week ago. I’m happy that I appear so healthy, I just sincerely wished I could feel as good as I look. I was still in pain so I stayed on the periphery for the most part, today however, it’s clear that yesterday may have been a bit much.

To be frank, I’m over looking good because of prednisone. It’s hard to explain to everyone that right now looks are deceiving and that I’d give however awful I feel (usually a hard 7/8 out of 10 these days) to someone else in a heartbeat. Brain fog is killing me, I’m always super out of it and irritated because I’m in pain. I feel sorry to my partner since he’s still not yet able to pin point the signs that I’m in a flare without me telling him. It boggles him that I can look so perfectly fine and have to hobble because of stiffness and pain. And I’m sure it boggles others as well.",1coduou

lupus,Farxiga?,"Seeing very little on it here. Curious since my mother’s nephrologist is recommending she goes on it. She’s had a flare up that hasn’t quite settled.  Her GFR has had a downward trend from the high 20s to low 20s and hasn’t seen much improvement despite being put on Prednisone (in that past it was the golden solution in managing her flare ups and getting her results back to a good place). I’m weary of it since it’s still sorta new to treating kidney disease and some folks on Facebook talk about being beaten down by its side effects.

Anyone with experience with it? Would deeply appreciate any stories.",1cokiyu
lupus,The gift that keeps on giving /s,"I'm finally almost back to ""normal"" -whatever that is- after a 3 month flare that resulted in the use of a walker, multiple trips to the ER, and my resignation at work. 

As a little treat, my husband sent me on a relaxing resort weekend. I should have known better than to relax and let me guard down, as every time I go out in public I seem to get sick.   I got home Sunday night, by Monday night I was starting to feel congested. 

Fast forward to today (thursday).. I got put on 2 antibiotics, for sinus, ear, AND eye infections.   Praying this doesn't send my body into another flare.  Ahh, compromised immune systems; the gift that keeps on giving. ",1co0zxs
lupus,Mother’s Day blues- sad post warning ,"Hi friends. Just here because I’m having a tough time. I turned 30 in September and got diagnosed with SLE shortly after. With a combination of SLE, fibromyalgia, sjogrens, Raynauds, and arthritis in both SI joints, both hips and both knees as well as mental health issues me and my doctors think it’s better to choose not to physically have children. I’ve never known for sure if 100% wanted kids or not and always thought “well if my body says no that’ll be the answer I accept” but now that my body’s pretty much saying no, it’s making me feel less than. I’m seeing ex’s(my first love that I just started talking to again found out he got a girl pregnant just before we started talking again after 13 years), friends, family, and just literally everyone having kids and experiencing being a mother and it’s suddenly shattering my heart. With Mother’s Day coming up, I truly don’t know how I’m going to get through the day with seeing everyone’s babies and seeing everyone who’s a mom be so proud and happy. So many comment on “when you have kids” “wait until you have kids” or “well you shouldn’t have kids then” “when will you have kids” and all that shit is really starting to get to me and I don’t know how to mentally handle it anymore. I’m just mourning the thought of motherhood I guess 😓 ",1cnw0lz
lupus,Flare and emergency room,"I’m having a really bad flare. The last time I felt this bad was January. I started cell cept 1500 mg in February and felt great until a few days ago. I took 5mg steroid Monday, 10, Tuesday, 20 yesterday and started a 6 day pack (I think the high dose is 30) today.

I’m beyond fatigued and achy but I’m also very thirsty and feeling warm.

I called my rheumatologist (who I just saw yesterday) and her office told me to go to the emergency department.

I don’t get what the ER is going to do for me. I don’t have the energy to sit for 6 hrs to be told they can’t do anything. I don’t have the energy to drive myself so I have to wait for my husband.

Am I being brushed off or is it worth it to go? I just want to feel better.

ETA: I called my doc back and they insisted I go. The ER saw me, ran a bunch of labs which all came back normal and said the steroids I’m on was enough and sent me home. I already have an appointment with a new endo who hopefully can handle flares better than this one. It’s not the first time. Thanks all.",1co5uh5
lupus,lupus nephritis + renal diet experience,"hi, 22f just got diagnosed with lupus nephritis class V on Friday. it’s been a rough week but trying to hang in there. the killer for me is this renal diet. i’ve spoken with a dietician already but i guess i’m looking for others’ stories and experiences with renal diet and how you all carry on. i know my kidneys can get better, and i’m not expecting to be fully normal but is there any possibility of getting to enjoy at least a little bit of normal food again? i know this is a journey and it will take time, just looking for a glimmer of hope that maybe i can have a bite of ice cream in the future

lupus,Grey cast to skin,"Hello! 

I wanted to know if anyone else is experiencing this because I just can’t figure it out. 

I was diagnosed with SLE/MCTD (two different rheums gave different diagnoses) a couple years ago. At the time, I was having red rashes all over my face, hands, neck, and chest. It seemed like it was due to photosensitivity but I never have my neck or chest uncovered outside so I couldn’t tell for sure. Anyways, I started plaquenil and my rashes are almost completely gone after a year on it. However I’ve noticed that I have a really strange grayish cast on my face, neck, and hands. Is this due to the plaquenil? I’ve always had medium olive skin but now I kind of look like a corpse lol",1coaysv

lupus,Kaiser Benlysta IV Experience,"I couldn't find much information regarding Kaiser's Benlysta IV process online so I wanted to share. Not sure if it is like this for every Kaiser. I recently started in SoCal and it took ~3 weeks including lab testing prior to getting an appointment set up. A nurse called me to set up an appointment at Kaiser's cancer center. They book three hour appointments since they don't start mixing the medicine until you officially check in. 

 You wait about an hour and a half while they hook you up to a saline drip. They hook it up to the top of your hand, then Benlysta takes about an hour to administer. They monitor your blood pressure throughout. The RN warned me about fatigue and to take Tylenol to avoid migraine. She was right so I took the day after too. 

I asked about the cost and they said it will be sent to me with an explanation of benefits in a couple weeks. I'm sure you can ask for this ahead of time but I like to live on the edge of financial ruin 🤪.

lupus,Chronic gastritis ,Has anyone had gastritis or stomach pain with auto immune? I had daily pain and finally saw a GI doctor last year. The endoscopy showed chronic inflammation. I've been taking a PPI for over a year now and I still get stomach pain. All this started before I ever had my first flare. It was really hard taking prednisone because it started hurting my stomach. I had to go to a low dose to avoid irritating it and ended up stopping it early. I want to heal my stomach because i know I'll need prednisone again sometime. But I'm discouraged at how long it's been. Every time I try to back off on the PPI I get pain. I've read that autoimmune disease can cause gastritis too. All these crazy symptoms I was having for a year and didn't understand until I got a diagnosis. ,1cnnwp2

I guess the universe just had a little something extra for me and I got laid off today very unexpectedly (along with my whole team, 30 other people). I guess I am just looking for some advice? I am sad and scared and stressed, and then more stressed because I am scared my symptoms will get worse over all the stress, scared feelings. Has anyone gotten through this before? Do you have any advice? For not only managing lupus, but unemployment? Is there any additional unemployment things I should look at now with a lupus diagnosis?

lupus,Steroids,"I suffer from terrible body aches when I get my Lupus flares. They are worse than any flu/covid body aches that I have ever had, by far. I would say they are the number one issue I wish i could relieve. I’ve been prescribed separate rounds of steroids but they don’t help at all, not even a little bit it seems. 

I have started Saphnelo infusions but have only had 1 round so far and know they can take a little while to help. 

Does anyone else not have any relief from prescribed steroids? I guess I just don’t understand why they aren’t helping, I want something to help with the pain so bad. I have 3 little kids that need their mom and I don’t have anyone close that can help out. My husband works full time and can’t constantly take time off of work and so I just push through like always.  I’m just desperate for something to help. 😭",1cn5ao9

lupus,"Okay, y’all, I’m freaking out. I injured my knee at a big box store 2 1/2 weeks ago. Saw the orthopedist Tuesday and, although I don’t have an MRI until Friday, surgery is imminent for at least a torn meniscus. I was supposed to have my infusion tomorrow…..","But the ortho said I need to push it until at least 3-4 weeks after surgery, whenever that is. Hopefully, next week. 

So, I will be dealing with the injury/surgery pain PLUS the FULL lupus pain. I’m still at a 5/10 pain on my best days. Along with the pain from my other health issues like Sjögren’s, fibro, RA.

A few months after I started the infusions, the week before my next one, the pain/symptoms would come back with a vengeance. Worse than before I started the infusions. I’ve been on them for just over a year and that window has gotten much smaller, a few days before, and isn’t as severe. 

What’s going to happen now?  The major hip pain I have is already starting to come back. My current pain control helps a lot, but even WITH my infusion, I’m still in pain. Add surgery pain on top of that. 

I’m scared. I’m scared of how bad the pain will be. Maybe my PCP, who does my pain management, will change to a stronger medication for this time? Will/can she do that since I’m picking up my pain meds today?? I’m worried that the Benlysta won’t work as well when I restart it. (This happened to a friend’s daughter. She was on one biologic for crohns that was helping really well. A new one came out that her doctor wanted to try. It didn’t work, so she went back on the previous one and…it no longer worked.) I’m worried that I will have to go another whole year to get to the level I am at currently. So many variables. 

The surgery itself doesn’t scare me. I had 2 on that knee before I was 17 for JRA . Four in the other. 3 before I was 17, two for JRA, one after a car accident.  The fourth was for an eerily similar injury at work 20 years ago. A lot of experience, but I’m not 30 anymore and I was actually really healthy when that happened. My RA AND fibro were both in remission and the lupus and Sjogrens diagnoses were far in the future. 

We also live 45 minutes away from physical therapy. So, that’s a pain in the ass. 

Ugh. I don’t like this. 

Any advice would also be welcome.

lupus,Cold sores,"I started having a lupus flare on Friday and then over the weekend I developed what my PCM believes to be a cold sore above my top lip. She says it’s likely caused by HSV1 that was dormant in my body for years, but due to a weakened immune system, it cause a cold sore. 

Does anyone know if you can get cold sores without having HSV1. I’m devastated to think I may be a lifelong carrier of this virus. I remember my dad getting frequent cold sores when I was a kid, so if it is HSV1, that’s likely where I was exposed. But I’m 36 and have never dealt with it before. Since I started a bad flare last week I was really hoping that this is some random lupus fluke. 

I just followed up with my PCM to see if I could get tested to confirm or rule out HSV1. 

Any insight would be appreciated.",1cnde3w
lupus,Does anyone else get bloody stool during flare ups?,"
WARNING : gross tma

have been having flare ups even with my plaquenil and I noticed near the end of my worst flare ups I have bloody stool. Like really bloody. I don’t want to go to the ER I’m stubborn and all that and yeah if I tell my doctor he will tell me to so I’ll wait for August when I see him. But I didn’t know if it was related except they always almost happen together. Flare up, extreme fatigue swollen lymph nodes everywhere and painful swollen joints and fingers. And the. Eventually one or two days of straight poo blood. Is this a thing?

I am on this med now but by my next appointment if the flare ups don’t stop they move me to methotrexate. ",1cnam4r
lupus,A flare up from motion sickness?,"Hi guys! Recently went on a 6 hour ferry ride (3 hours both ways), though on separate days and got pretty motion sick. I took medication for it, but it was like my body knew I was supposed to be sick, so I still felt ill for the duration of it. The following day, I was so fatigued, like post-infusion fatigued, and it almost felt like the start of a cold. 

Day after, much better in terms of fatigue, but it just seemed like my lupus was flaring up intensely. Random pains sometimes when I took a breath, very stiff body (no new workouts or anything strenuous) and all of a sudden I need to use the restroom more frequently. 

I'm assuming my body was just under stress from the travel? But is this normal?",1cn80dk

lupus,Nioxin system...  ,"Went to get my hair refreshed yesterday.  My roots had grown out and I decided to root match to get a close match to my natural color.  I've been noticing some changes in my hair since being on imuran.  Not patchy loss...  but overall thinning it seems.  My hair was fine in texture even before Lupus and meds.  But I have felt like the toll has been taken and I've seen a lot more thinning in general.  

I asked about rosemary and caster oil scalp treatments.  He said they're great but to be careful about how often I use them since caster oil can strip the hair.  

Did the nioxin dermabrasion treatment on my scalp.  Just used the shampoo and conditioner today.  

I'm curious to see how it all turns out in a month.  

Anyone else using this?  

We also talked about extensions for future use.  I'm thinking of getting a bangs piece.  I like how I look with fringe but the upkeep on trims and also the fact that I'd have less hair overall with the fringe has made that a difficult choice.  And I figure this would give me an option.  ",1cn7yyo
lupus,Scared to start prednisone,"Scared to start prednisone

Hi all! I was diagnosed at the end of February, but have been in a flare since last summer. I have terrible joint pain, mostly on my left side, in my knee and elbow- though, oddly, in the past couple months (since starting HCQ), my neck and right shoulder also seem to be affected. I also have pretty bad brain fog and notable fatigue, though from reading through this thread, nowhere near as bad as what others seem to be experiencing. I have no organ involvement as far as I know. 

My rheumatologist initially recommended that I do a course of prednisone, but we agreed to just try HCQ first instead, because I was really worried about the side effects of steroids. I have pretty much every anxiety disorder imaginable— generalized anxiety, OCD, PTSD, panic disorder, etc.— and am really scared of the psychological side effects. Even caffeine makes me feel like I’m dissociating and gives me panic attacks on days when I’m feeling more anxious than than my usual already-high anxiety baseline. I’m going through a lot of changes right now in my life on top of this diagnosis, and have seen a lot of horror stories on here about not being able to get off steroids, so I wanted to try other things before going that route. 

Since my initial appointment, I’ve gone all in on holistic/natural ways of trying to manage my symptoms and get out of this flare. I have started eating much cleaner (though I was already eating pretty clean before) and cut out alcohol. I have also been doing acupuncture, craniosacral therapy, and nutrition counseling, on top of the physical therapy I started in the fall. I go to the gym around 3x/week and have started yoga as well. I feel like I’ve done pretty pretty much everything I can other than adding in more meds and my symptoms are only getting worse. 

I just saw my rheumatologist for my first follow-up, and since, if anything, my symptoms are worse than when I started HCQ, he wants me to start methotrexate and low-dose prednisone. Since I’m so worried about the psychological side effects, the plan is to start me on 2.5mg for a week, and then increase by 2.5 weekly (provided that I can tolerate it), up to 10mg- and then taper off, for a total of 6 weeks. I agreed to the plan because I don’t want to have long-term mobility issues from being in such a long-lasting flare, and the other more holistic stuff I’m doing doesn’t seem to be enough…but after reading about how difficult it is to taper off, I’m having second thoughts again. I don’t want to be on steroids for life, in more pain than before I started, or deal with the anxiety/panic-y side effects, but maybe it’s worth it if it’s my best shot at getting out of this flare?

I guess what I’m seeking is some advice from others who have bad anxiety, and/or had a lot of hesitation about starting prednisone initially. If you could go back and make a different choice, would you? Is it worth it? Are 2.5-10mg doses low enough that I might not have to worry about increased anxiety? 

Side note: I am also trans and on testosterone, which in itself triggers mood swings and sometimes irrational anger…so compounding that is also a concern for me as well, though less so than the anxiety.

Thanks in advance, and sorry for such a long-winded post! ",1cn79v2
lupus,Impostor Syndrome,"As someone newly diagnosed, I'm just wondering if anyone else ever felt a sort of impostor syndrome when they first got the diagnosis? Basically, I've lived with symptoms for years, and I just kind of incorporated them into the rest of my life and told myself to suck it up and be tough. Maybe I was in denial, but I really did think everyone got into their 40s and had joint pain, was tired all the time, started forgetting things, had other various aches and pains and a fever here and there. So now, there's this little voice in my head telling me, ""you don't have lupus, don't be so dramatic, stop malingering."" It's making it hard for me to do the things I should be doing, such as improving my diet (which is already pretty good, but does still include some processed food, occasional alcohol, and other sort of inflammatory stuff), taking my supplements, etc., because on some level I'm convinced I can't possibly have lupus, I'd be sicker, etc. 

It's really weird because getting the diagnosis initially made me feel vindicated in a way - like, there's an actual *reason* I'm always exhausted, or that my knees or hips will suddenly start hurting so badly I can hardly walk, or that my pleuritic pain keeps flaring. But a few weeks later, I'm finding that little voice telling me that I am malingering, and there isn't actually anything wrong with me except laziness. Has anyone else experienced this? I feel like my brain is being pulled in two directions at once.",1cmamyv

lupus,Plaquenil side effects ," 
Hi guys, A little bit of a weird post because I don’t have lupus. However I do take plaquenil for an autoimmune skin condition called morphea/localized scleroderma. 
I know a lot of people with lupus take plaquenil so I am seeking advice from people who may be familiar with the medication. I was tolerating my plaquenil well for the first few weeks with no side effects. I’m probably near week 6 of taking it now and I’ve had some what I’m assuming are side effects for the past week. I’m not sure if it’s from the plaquenil but that’s the only change I’ve had that I can think of. 
I’ve been having really bad headaches/ migraines every day. They don’t go away with naps or sleep. I’ve also have had trouble sleeping. This is very strange for me because I’m usually always tired and have no trouble falling asleep as I work night shift. I’ve had to take melatonin nearly every night for the past week. I feel constantly dizzy? I’m not sure if that’s how I should describe it or if it’s just my headache causing it but my eyes take a while to focus when turning quickly. I’m not sure if these are side effects as I was tolerating the medicine great up until last week (if it is from the medicine)
I only take 200mg once daily. 
Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! ",1cmwd3m
lupus,Myopic shift?,"Has anyone had this?

I had a usual eye exam today (at optometrist) and apparently I've had a myopic shift, i.e. my eyesight has gotten a *lot* worse in a short period of time. Based on my age, she said it might be due to an underlying health problem like diabetes. She seemed really concerned about that, but as far as I know I don't have any symptoms that would suggest it.

I have UCTD and apparently conditions like Lupus can also cause this. Has anyone had this? I don't relate to any of the other potential causes. I don't know, I'm kind of concerned whatever the cause. I've noticed that my eyesight has gotten increasingly bad (I'm nearsighted and wear glasses for it). The eye doctor said I should definitely talk to my GP if I have any diabetes symptoms, should probably bring this up, but other than that gave me my new prescription and sent me on my way. I'm going to be seeing an ophthalmologist for dry eye too, no idea if it's relevant to the worsening eyesight though. Hopefully it's no big deal but wondering if anyone has had something similar.

So...aside from lupus I have bipolar disorder, ptsd and ocd. Any others out there trying to balance physical and mental health? I had to come off of lithium so that I can take meloxicam. I was put on tegretol instead but the plaquenil can lower its effects and vice-versa. I had to come off of anafranil which I was taking for ocd because I'm also on a low dose of zoloft and both with the plaquenil can cause long qt. Even just with the zoloft and plaquenil I have to get regular ekgs. I am currently on prednisone as well and have to be careful that it doesn't cause mania. Trying to balance everything is super frustrating and super exhausting. Thankfully I have a superb team of doctors and therapist and I'm doing well as far as mental health goes right now but darn it's a lot of work!!! Anyone else out there struggle with the balance?

lupus,Venting,"I don't know how to start writing this so bear with me. 

To begin, I'm very serious with my meds. I always take them on time and never skip. I make sure to use the rest time during classes to eat properly and take my meds. Everyone who knows me knows this, and I make sure to tell my professors about this, if we have an exam or some short of activity that counts for our grades. 

This causes some of my classmates and friends to make jokes, which I always humour. I'm very vocal and loudspoken about lupus, I don't mind jokes. 

One of my classmates, has depression and anxiety. Whenever I spoke with a professor about having to take my meds on certain times, she always went: ""oh, I take meds too!"". Which I went, ""yeah girly, medicated besties"" or something like that. 

The more we spoke about, I felt like we could understand each other about having to take prescription drugs. But she told me she doesn't take her meds, it's very rare if she does, because she likes to go party, drink and take drugs. And sometimes she simply can be bothered to take them. I don't judge, because I can understand not wanting to take pills every single day; it's depressing and hard to come on terms with. I also understood the need of some short of escapism of her illness. 

The conversation about meds ended like that, but one day, out of the blue, she came to me and said: ""Having depression and anxiety, or any kind of mental illness, is worse than a physical illness"". I simply replied: ""well, I don't know"" and left it like that. But honestly, it didn't sit right with me. I felt it was uncalled for. 

She didnt specifically mention lupus (or my RA in hands and knees) but i felt it was kind of mean, going out of her way to tell me that. I don't think she would say the same to a person with leukemia or cancer. Even if she thought that, she wouldn't. 

This is more like a vent post. I honestly have never thought about whats worse, if depression (her illness) or SLE. And honestly, I don't think I have the answer to that. But one thing I do ponder about is, she will never know the pain of having SLE, but a lupus patient, can know the pain of having depression- of the physical pain driving you mad and desperate.

It also bothers me a lot that, if she really considers her illness worse, why doesn't she take her meds seriously? I get it's hard, but you are conscious of a problem, a pain you have- she has stated the medication really helps her. I know the pain that I have felt, and know the future that waits for me if I don't take this seriously, thats why I take my meds. 

I know we have to be generous of others in pain, but I also have the right to felt hurt.",1cmim1r

lupus,Seeking advice. Girlfriend recent diagnose,"

Hey everyone,

I could use some guidance. My girlfriend, who's 30, recently got diagnosed with Lupus erythematosus. It's been tough for her, but she is a strong and amazing woman. Initially, her symptoms was an experienced breathing difficulties and pressure on the chest, which during her first doctors appointment turned out to be water on her heart, which got better after treatment. Nowadays unfortunately, she's is often very tired and incredibly pale.

I'm really worried about her wellbeing and comfort. Is it common for Lupus to make people pale and tired? How can I best support her through this? We're already in touch with her doctor, but I'd appreciate any insights or tips from those who've been through similar situations.

Thanks for any help you can offer.",1cm8r0d

mentalhealth,I hate my life,"Shorter version: I am a gay 20 year old guy who is not out and don't  feel like I can be because of the people I have been around and my job. I own a house I can barely afford and don't even like that much at all. I have pushed away all my friends and feel I lack the self confidence and personality to make new friends. 



I (M20) have been struggling with my mental health for a long time. I always chased after different things that I thought may make me more confident or feel better about myself but it never seems to work. I am gay but I've only felt safe enough to come out to a few people. My parents divorced when I was 12 and I lived with my mom in a rental house on a farm. I kind of developed a close relationship with the landlord (who Ill call A) and over the years he thought of me sort of as a son. He bought me several things including vehicles and four wheelers and such, which in turn made me feel like I could not let him down in a way. Although he was a pretty good guy he would make some homophobic comments which made me feel like I couldn't let him know I was gay. I tried to distance myself slightly from the relationship but my mom (who drank every night to the point she was very drunk) forced the relationship harder for me. She would make me feel bad about not wanting to spend time with him, and I never felt close enough to her (especially after the divorce and her also making me feel bad for wanting a relationship with my biological father, which overtime fell apart on its own. 

In my high school years I wasn't too sure what I wanted to do career wise but I knew I didn't wanna go into blue collar work because of the physical toll on your body and a lot of the people are not the kind I wanted to be surrounded by. I had expressed that to A, and he didn't really have much against it but I didn't know what I wanted to do and he did not like that fact.   I  didn't feel like college was for me at the time because I didn't have a set thing I wanted to go for, and my goal was to start a business, most likely landscaping as I had a lawn mower and did a few lawns at the time. I felt like my confidence in starting a business and myself was talked out of me by myself but also  because I never had any who I felt fully supported me. Once I was done with high school A was heavy on me that I needed to get a job which I didn't have anything against really but I didn't know what I wanted to do. He would ""give me shit"" that I was lazy or he needed to ""put a boot up my ass"" until one day when I got a phone call from an unknown number. It was a local business owner who got my phone number from A and wanted to offer me a job. Despite not really wanting to I ended up taking it since I didn't really have much else going and I felt like if I had said no A would have been on me even more and upset. 

it was always kind of my goal to buy a house to get away from my mother who I felt was overbearing and A who made me feel like I couldn't be myself. after a year and a half of working there I was able to buy a house. Going into the home buying process I wanted to buy a multi family home and ""house hack"" to keep my monthly expenses low and in turn be able to quit the job I hated and figure out what I wanted to do, possibly take on a job that payed a little lower. A didn't think I could look at the houses myself so he insisted on tagging along with me. I used a realtor who was A's daughter's best friend (who happened to be gay)'s mom. without fail, on the way to or from every house we looked at he made a comment to me about the fact my realtor's son was gay. That made me feel even more pressured to buy a house and I ended up spending more than I had wanted to after losing 5 offers prior to that. 

I have felt a great shame in myself since for buying THIS house. on top of hardly having any extra money to save after paying all my bills, I live across the road from one of my coworker's brother which makes me feel like I can't have any guys over because he may find out I'm gay which would be bad for me at my job (I feel). I have thought about getting a second job just to be able to save money or help pay this house down but I don't even have the energy by the time I am done with my current job. 

I had a car which was the only thing left that brought me any joy because it was pretty decent, fairly cheap and got good gas mileage but I crashed it a couple months ago. since I have been driving my truck which cost a lot in fuel and has issues. I want to get rid of it but if I decided to trade it in I would get nothing and if I sold it privately I would obviously need another vehicle to drive first. I can't stand the thought of another payment and don't have any money to buy anything decent. 

I have pushed almost everyone away and I hate it but I don't have much energy to make new relationships or rekindle my old ones. I want to sell my house so bad but I can't afford to. I want to quit my job but I don't know how I could make the same money (in order to pay my bills) outside of the work I'm in. I want make new friends and relationships but my lack of self confidence and having hid my self for so long and even more so since getting my job  makes that very hard for me. I am a decently attractive guy and Snapchat other guys around me and many have wanted to meet but I always make excuses to cover up my lack of confidence. 

I am no where near the place I thought I would be in high school and I feel like I am in a miserable position. I don't even feel like I can talk to anyone. Again, since the divorce I haven't felt that close with my family (such as my moms side, or 2/3 of my sisters because they always talked bad about my father and the fact I wanted to have a relationship with him \[which in the beginning he did too until I would 'let' my mom not see him\]) One of my sisters knows I am gay and I am very close with her but she joined the army 5 months ago so I haven't really been able to talk to her and its not the same for me anyway since I can't hang out with her. I don't feel like I can tell my online gay friends that I'm not out because I feel like they will look down at me for not being out at 20. 

I don't want to harm myself but I am so tired and over my life.

I dont expect anyone to read this but if you did thank you. I know I jumped around a lot and may not have made sense in some places but I needed to get a lot of this off my chest. ",1cp4mgv
mentalhealth,how do I get out my emotions if I can’t cry?,"I don’t know why I can’t cry, it could be medication or deeper mental health issues but either way when I feel strong emotions they feel stuck and it’s kind of painful (emotionally and physically). What do I do when I am feeling intense despair or something and I feel like I need to get the emotion out? Usually I just sit there until it goes away but it’s extremely uncomfortable for me and I feel like my skin is too tight the whole time.

mentalhealth,Can anyone tell me what i’m feeling?,"Hi, I need somebody to help me out here. So all my life i’ve been very stressed of how I speak to people and how i’m perceived. I constantly get nervous when i speak to people, even my own family, but even worse when talking to strangers. I stutter a lot and i have for years, since I was a little girl. Every time i speak to someone my heart races and I feel extremely nervous like they’re judging me or picking apart the way I speak. My stuttering gets worse at times but overall it’s pretty bad. Sometimes I can’t even get my words out. I have a hard time communicating with people because of this and it’s starting to affect my life now that i’m becoming an adult. Sometimes I even shake at the thought of speaking to somebody new or even when i’m about to speak to my family members. I have this constant worry that i’m not normal because of it and that I don’t come across as normal because of my stutter and i even try to put on a different personality in order to attempt to feel at ease sometimes. I can’t even buy a bus ticket without stuttering at the driver. I get super nervous that people won’t like me and try my hardest to act a certain way so that they will, but i feel like no matter what i do, people can always sense that i act odd because of how nervous i get. I don’t know what’s wrong with me and im genuinely jealous of people that can speak freely and be themselves without worrying. I’m always worrying. Can anybody tell me what might be wrong?

mentalhealth,I need help or else I'll di3,"I went through severe childhood trauma. It resulted in social anxiety. I still find it hard to talk to people when I'm out, but lately I'm trying to overcome it by talking to people more than I used to and getting myself out there. I think I'm getting the hang of it.

But the other problem that I'm facing and is getting out of hand is that I tend to take everything personally. When I was a kid I was blamed a lot. Even for mistakes that seemed normal. So everything seems directed towards me. For example, when my friends get busy and can't talk to me for a while, I start to believe that they hate me. I start to overanalyze and overthink.

I can’t stop obsessing over this. I have severe anxiety and ocd too. Does anyone else have self harm scars that they did as adults. I feel like this is a teenage thing and people understand.

mentalhealth,I really don't want to go to therapy-- are there alternatives?,"I (20F) am anxious and depressed. I also likely have some form of OCD. I am uninterested at college, have pretty low self esteem, and am panicky. My parents have suggested a therapist. This seems like the obvious solution I guess. However, I do not think that therapy will help this. In fact, I think it will make it worse. I hate the idea of sitting in a room with a stranger and having to talk to them for an hour straight. I would dread it, and not just in the sense where ""oh they know it's hard and they'll dig deep so they dread it like in Good Will Hunting with Robin Williams"", but like I actually don't think it will help. I don't think it is the right type of treatment. I also hate the idea of turning it into more of a thing than it already is and feeling even less normal. I don't know what I would even say to them. I don't have any deep reasons to feel the way I feel; if they asked what was wrong or what I was upset about in particular I don't think I could answer. I'm not receptive to the idea of therapy in general, and it seems like therapy is for people who want therapy (""they help you help yourself"" sort of thing). I don't want to sit there while a stranger repeats what I say back to me, or sit there while a stranger says, ""ok but why do you really feel like that"", and I definitely don't want to do any games or ""homework"". But my parents really want me to go and I'm starting to feel guilty. They think that going will fix me immediately, even though they admitted they don't know what therapy is like or what the lady they're suggesting I see weekly would do. I don't know, the thought of it makes me feel icky and honestly kind of angry. I get why they want to send me to therapy, I do, but I really would like to avoid going. So, are there any alternatives that don't involve sitting in an office with somebody? What other activities have helped your mental health and coping skills, and to have a more normal life? Or, if you have been to therapy and it's not actually anything like I described, feel free to share your experience if you want.

I know that I fucked up so much and I know that there is no fixing it, even if they say there is. I don’t think I can change, some people won’t ever heal and I think I’m one of them. 

I was trying to keep the peace, trying to stop anyone other than me from getting hurt but I failed so fucking badly and it’s all my fault. I hurt them, I made them cry. I tried so hard not to be one kind of shitty person that I completely became another type of shitty person. I became a bully, and a bitch. 

I don’t want to keep hurting my best friends. I don’t want to make them cry. I know that I’m not what they need, I don’t know if I can ever be what they need. Maybe the past broke me too much, maybe i just wasn’t meant to have friends. 

I don’t want to leave them. I love them so much it hurts. They’ve saved my life and they were there during some of the worst parts of my college years and trying to deal with the old grief from my father. But I can’t stop hurting them and I’m not what they need. It’s for the better if I just remove myself from them. They’ll realize that it’s better that way, that everything is easier without me. That I’m the problem, and once I’m gone, everything is better. 

Should I leave? Should I stay? Am I just fucking up again? How do I stop hurting them because I don’t want to hurt anyone, I hate hurting people, especially my best friends.

Then when im going back home i often have to wait a lot longer for transport to arrive. It all results in having to wake up at 5:30 am or 5:00 am and getting back home around 5 pm every day. I usually consume a bunch of melatonin before going to bed just so i can fall asleep. For the majority of this whole year i was sleeping roughly about 3-5 hours a day along with waking up a couple times in between. 36 people are in my class and im deeply scared of any interaction except my few friends i know. I panic every time any teacher picks students out to do a task on the board in front of everyone. My head hurts all the time and i can't get rid if it, i live in constant stress along with a couple phobias i've had for a better part of my life. When i wake up at night or fall asleep i often hear noices of things like ring, the speech of people and other stuff i hear every day, along with having this weird sense of chaos in my head like i can't understand what's happening and where i am, like every experience i had that day clumped into one and it makes me exhausted when i experience it. I can't remember the last time i felt relaxed, or should i say, completely and utterly tired and helpless even on holiday. I feel like i'm getting dumber and lost in reality, i am afraid of cancers in general as well, so i'm terrified it might be a brain tumor. It also appears that i lost interest in everything i ever liked and i think im a completely different person then i was a couple of years ago. I don't know what to do, i want to be happy but i just desire death so much at this point, the only thing stronger than that is my fear of death that essentially stops me from killing myself.

I'll admit I haven't always made the smartest decisions but what I hate about myself the most besides the fact that Im disabled which for that i deserve to get punched in the face 10 times everyday i choose to keep existing is the fact that I'm actually a nice person and everytime I ever said I'm sorry to anyone I wish I could take it back and replace all those apologies with something offensive.  It honestly offends me that people get so easily offended over something like a racist joke or a crude comment about a big group of particular people.  And you know why?  Because at least that joke or that comment is about everyone in a certain group and not just one person singled out.  I've learned and and just accepted that I'm overweight, disabled and because stupid people are nice I'm a fucking stupidass pathetic piece of fuckingshit ""nice"" person and I hate myself every single waking moment that I'm still here as me because it's embarrassing.  I used to enjoy driving now I haven't had a car for 2 years because my first car and second car were both stolen and I will never ever be even somewhat ok ever again and I realize that I have nothing.  Nothing I buy with my own money, nothing that's gifted to me, id never be lucky enough to win a fucking thing in my entire life but if I did win something cool its not mine either.  I'm buying it for some lowlife hoodrat to have because some thieving lieing whore who'd sell her own kid into sex slavery for a meth hoot...That is the person who owns everything I buy because she deserves it more.  Everyone thinks I'm spoiled just cuz my parents aren't divorced or some bs but my parents treat me like a fucking retard.  I can't be myself around them at all ever.  But that's what I get for choosing to live with a learning disability it makes you a fucking embarrassment and everyone will treat you like shit too or say out loud what great people they are cuz they know how to act around a disabled person.  Wow my friend really just said that? Reminding myself I'm a fucking mentally retarded piece of shit who ain't worth getting paid any amount of money to do anything and also reminding myself anything I think I'm good at...I'm not that good. Super bitter about being broke when I'm beyond broke....so broke nothing will ever be mine because I belong to everyone else. I exist just to publicly suffer my entire existence so other people that aren't nice and have lots of money can feel happy because those people matter and It's pathetic for someone like me to even pretend ill be ok.  I won't.  My mom made me apologize the only time I ever said FU to my Dad even tho he said I was a burden to society and a second class citizen and I have no right to keep the fact I'm disabled private because other people have to work with me.and put up with me and it's unfair to them and I should just be happy to even be acknowledged as a.person at all.",1cp9nje
mentalhealth,I’m being watched,"Okay, the title was a bit of an exaggeration. I don’t think i’m actually being watched. I made a post on here a couple days back about having random feelings of anxiety and paranoia, and since then it’s only gotten worse. It used to only be when I was alone in my room or walking my dog outside, but now the feeling is everywhere, even in public places. I constantly feel like I have eyes on me. Always. I constantly feel a presence behind me; which makes it almost impossible to work at my desk at home or in school. I constantly have to turn around and check if there’s someone behind me. Even laying in bed right now typing this, with my headboard against the wall, I still feel like something’s watching me through the window.

mentalhealth,My struggles will soon be recognized ,"For context I am 19 and have been depressed for probably 4-5 years now with other mental health problems. I have never talked to anyone about them because I didn’t want anyone to know there was something wrong with me. I guess I have always had so much pressure to be perfect I didn’t want to have a problem and have always suppressed the feelings and thoughts I’ve had. I have often thought about getting help but ultimately never decided to be strong enough to find help. 
But as the title says my problems will so come to light. This started a few days ago when my parents wanted to see my grades from my second semester of college. I tried to hide them because they were awful and I was put on academic probation. But I had to show them and they started to question what was wrong as throughout high school I was a straight A student. I told them the truth but not the whole truth as I still didn’t want them to know what I truly struggled with. But I said that I had a hard time focusing which is true. So they think I have a mental health problem like adhd and want me to see a doctor to address the problem. They scheduled me an appointment this month. As I’ve been thinking about this I feel like this is my chance to finally address everything that I’ve been feeling and going through. I’m not sure how it will go but I feel good that this might actually be my chance to get help and maybe be happy again like I was when I was younger. I’m nervous but excited to finally get help.

mentalhealth,Struggling ,"So, I (31F) am a massive mess. And I'm not just saying this, my life has literally been upside down since December of 2022. I'll explain.

In December of 2022, I was working as kitchen staff in an underground mining camp. I worked ""rotation"" type shifts (2 weeks on, 2 weeks off) and was sent home a few days before the end of my rotation, because I was having some health problems that could not be ignored any longer. I came home, and have never been able to go back. 

In January 2023, I started having testing done to see what was wrong with me. My already questionable balance and coordination had gone down the drain, I was in pain 24/7, I was having dizzy spells, my chronic fatigue was at its all time worst, and I had unintentionally lost 40 pounds between October 2022 and mid January 2023 because I couldn't hold food down (when I could convince my body to accept food to begin with). 

My already massive body image issues and eating disorder were triggered by the weightloss, and I continued to lose about another 20 lbs between January and June 2023.

Throughout all of this, I had begun dating someone new. I had known him for years, but the relationship was still in its early days. Something that will become relevant in a second, is that I have prior experience working as a nurse. I haven't worked in the field in years, but nonetheless... 

In early December, my boyfriend (at the time just friends) informed me that he had finally gotten the date for his much needed shoulder surgery. I was very happy for him, and mentioned that I was happy to help if he needed anything while he was recovering. 

We started ""officially"" dating a few weeks after he had told me about the date of his surgery. In the end, we both decided for him to stay a few weeks with me after his surgery, and when he was recovered enough, he would go back to his own place. It ended up being that both our circumstances changed before he was healed, and he never left. I was more than happy to have him with me though. Despite his own issues and struggles, he was very kind and patient with me, and I tried very hard to ensure that he received the best care possible while he was recovering from his surgery. 

In May of 2023, boyfriend's ex wife said and did some shady sheet, and he ended up being arrested for it. By the time we were able to get through all the courts and all the legal stuff, he did not come home until September 2023. These were some of the hardest and most traumatizing months of my entire life. 

In the week after his arrest, my health took its biggest dive yet, and I became relegated to full time wheelchair use. At this point, I was assessed by my OT and RRTS for a manual wheelchair, and it was ordered. I ended up electing to rent one of the same model until mine came in. (I did not receive my customized chair until mid July) 

The first weekend after his arrest was Mother's day weekend (exactly one year ago this week). It was so hard on me. My partner was not able to be home with me, his parents had his kids (and wouldn't let me see them), my family pulled some crap, it was just torture. I wasn't even able to hear from boyfriend, because it took quite a while for the first bit of money I sent in to get to him. I had a friend who took pity on me and dragged me out to her family camp for a day, which was good and hard. I spent the entire time crying about everything, and feeling totally and utterly defeated.

June was a mess of court dates, hoping he would be released, and medical appointments. I was scared to say too much about my medical issues to boyfriend, because I was terrified of it all myself, and i also felt that telling him the full reality while he was helpless to do anything for me would have been cruel. So, I put on a good face for him and tried to keep our visits and phone calls centered on him and being hopeful that he would be released sooner than later.  The rest of the summer pretty much followed suit. 

Eventually, his parents started allowing me to see his kids again. As much as I enjoyed having a little purpose with them around, it was also exhausting. I was masking 100% while I was with them, doing all sorts of stuff with them and making sure that the impact of their father being absent was as minimal as possible. But when I dropped them off and got home... I felt like death. 

I would go home, lay down in bed, and not leave again until something forced me to. I got to a point where I did nothing but in person visits with boyfriend, activities with his kids, and doctors appointments. I did not leave my bed for anything that did not absolutely demand my presence. And nobody noticed. 

It was months before anyone said anything. And even when they did, it wasn't that they had noticed that I was massively depressed and hiding from the world. No, it was how much weight I had lost. 

So I let it all go. I stopped eating altogether. I was still consuming enough water, and kept taking my medication, but for 27 days, I did not eat. Nobody noticed. I went to visits at the remand, and plastered on as happy a facade as I could. He never noticed that I was so miserable, but he noticed that I was losing weight. I brushed it off as ""just eating healthier portions and being more active since I have the chair"". He stopped bringing it up. 

Nobody in the rest of my life noticed either. Nobody who asked how I was, actually wanted the truth. They just wanted to appear polite. It was fake and I had no more patience for it. I stopped talking to all but my very best friend about anything deeper than the weather.  

When boyfriend was finally released in mid September, I had gotten used to masking myself with literally everyone. I was so scared to show him (or anyone else) how bad things had been for me. So I kept it all in. For weeks, I did everything I could to stay quiet and not tell him how much I had and still was, struggling. 

I had a hard time dealing with the version of my partner that had come home to me. He was anxious and on edge 24/7. He was terrified of public spaces and people. He was snappy and inconsiderate of other people. He was dismissive of how I felt about what we had both gone through, while simultaneously refusing to talk to me openly and honestly about his experience. 

I was expected to somehow just *know* what I was supposed to do or say in every single gle situation. I was expected to do everything he needed, when he needed it, with zero direction on what the needs were. I was (and still am) accused of mothering him, but if I backed off of doing these tasks, I was called cold and uncaring for not automatically doing them for him. (He is still like this to this very day)

These issues have (obviously) been carried and unresolved for a year now. He still won't just tell me what he wants or how he wants it. I am still expected to know exactly what is going on and handle it accordingly. When I inevitably fail at this, I am shamed, guilted, and verbally abused for my failures. 

A few weeks after his September release, I had gathered the courage, and tried to talk to him about my experiences, feelings,  emotional state, and mental well-being in the 6 months prior. This did not go well. He took my attempts at being honest about my feelings and emotions as personal attacks against him.  It got ugly. Our relationship has never recovered. 

The last six months has been exactly the same (for me) as the months that he was gone away. I am miserable. I try to talk to him about it, but I can't say anything right. He always takes it as an attack on him. My health has continued its decent into the pits of hell. I am now waiting for another new wheelchair. This time is a full power unit. I am depressed as hell, no matter how i try to sugarcoat this new chair. I am not taking the loss of my mobility well. The acceptance of my situation is there, but the mental strength needed to mask myself against everyone elses incessant questions is not. 

My social life does not exist. I am unable to get to the end of our driveway on my own. I tiptoe around our home (figurative tiptoes) and am constantly in fear of upsetting him. Life has become a constant anxiety attack, trying to guess what I can or can't do with him. 

I am just so tired. My life is a mess. I am a mess. I have nobody to talk honestly to. I feel like I am drowning. What do I do?",1cp3xe9
mentalhealth,"""Insane"" Thoughts","Everyday I feel paranoid about being in the dark, or certain rooms of the house due to my imagination, turning corners in places with dark rooms on the other-side cause me to imagine or slightly picture a horrific image of a head that resembles someone within my family with a malformed face and believe it might slowly turn around the corner and look at me.

Whenever I extremely lack sleep, the images within my head become more visible within my actual vision and are worse to deal with. *(They usually happen regardless of loss of sleep.)*

I'm sometimes afraid to fall asleep due to the fact whenever I dream (which is usually never) its a nightmare that mimics IRL and when you figure out it's not it'll deform the faces of people around you and scream ear-piercingly loud.

All of this is very involuntary and it's caused me to not want to exit my room at night or leave my room at all, I've been feeling scared constantly and like life isn't real, and that these mimic dreams are my real life, and everything always feels off because of this, as I'll constantly believe that the nightmare will start again and I'll just wake up, is this something I should go to a doctor for, I'm aware medical advice isn't allowed, but I'm unsure if this is ""normal"" to deal with.

mentalhealth,Are your recent memories foggy/faded too?,"Hey everyone. 22F here. First of all, apologies if this is not the relevant sub for my query but it is the closest I could find.

So, I know past memories are foggy/ cloudy for everyone (I suppose?), But my recent memories of past 4 years (even 2 years in few cases) are really foggy. I don't remember the major chunks of events, only when I start to remember, I realise, "" Oh that happened too!!!"" almost as if they are the new moments. I don't know if I'm making sense.

It wouldn't have been a issue if it were of random or unimportant things but these memories are releted to people I really cherished at a point in my life. Does it makes sense that my favourite people are slipping away from my mind and so are the moments spent with them, important dates that I could never imagined, I could forget. I don't know what's wrong with me.

And it is not just about forgetting or moving on from them, but it is really cloudy and confusing in my mind right now. Also, the timeline,when those people were in my life, I don't remember the most of it. Is this how it is supposed to be? I can remember, only if I focus too much and start recalling events one by one. 

I have never met anyone with the same issue as mine. Everyone can tell their experience in details, as if it was just yesterday, which is not the case for me.

She took the meds maybe twice and since then she’s been off the hinges. So spontaneous and ignoring all her children. She recently decided we were important again and she’s calmed down a bit but now it’s all about aliens. She says they steal things from her like parts from her car or her cell phone. She stays up all night watching the cameras and then telling us the crazy things she’s seen. Most recently they’re shooting red light beams that cause immediate pain in only her neck. It’s been months of this so now my family is starting to buy into it too and me and my younger sister are the only skeptics left. To me this seems like some sort of paranoia or hallucinations.

mentalhealth,I'm in the process of adopting a puppy but I'm really struggling. I need some advice,"So I (26f) started fostering a German Shepherd/Hound puppy 3 months ago, he was around 4-5 months when we got him. When we got him he was a handful and he had a really sensitive stomach so he would have to go out alot, if we didn't get him out in time he would go to the bathroom in this kennel. I thought I would have no problem training him because I trained all my other dogs with ease, I was so wrong! I agreed to adopt him from the rescue 2 months ago thinking everything will get better. I'm so stressed with him, I have tried training him but he still won't listen. He pulls me and my mom so hard while walking that we have gotten hurt. We thought he would be good for our other dog due to her being depressed after we put down our 16 year old dog, but he plays so rough with her that she doesn't want to be around him. My mom is done and wants me to ask the rescue to take him back. I'm conflicted I love him and I have booked dog training classes that start in June and once I finish paying the rescue (payment plan) they will fix him and give him the rest of his shots, so I can take him to dog day care when I'm at work or school. I just don't know how much longer I can take him biting, pulling and having accidents in his kennel before the trainings. My mom is really stressing me out as well which is adding to the stress he's giving me. I feel like if I give him back to the rescue I'm abandoning him.

mentalhealth,Had to make a tough choice,"So to start, I’m 21(f) and bipolar. I’m referring to my child as they so this is sort of anonymous. My dad and sister had it. Cancer took my dad, and the bipolar took my sister(I was 16 for both) I’ve been on meds since I was 14 and also in and out of facilities for various reasons I won’t get into. 
I had a baby last July, and I tried to unalive myself last October due to severely untreated postpartum depression and anxiety. I ended up being involuntarily committed to a ward for a week and a half. I got the help I needed and I came home doing good. My baby came home again(they had been staying with their grandma and their dad while I was gone). Everything was good, but long story short my insurance dropped me so I had to go cold Turkey off my meds bc I couldn’t pay out of pocket. 
It’s been abt 2 months with no meds and my baby has had to stay with my mil a lot again. She doesn’t mind, and I know she doesn’t… but I definitely do mind. I am nonfunctional right now and I miss my baby. I have so much guilt and anxiety and I just want to be a good mother for them. Now let me clear something up: I don’t ever get physical w anyone and especially not my child. The reason they haven’t stayed here is because their father and I have decided they deserve a more stable(BUT TEMPORARY) environment until I get back on my meds.
 I HAVE fixed my insurance issue, so I have insurance at this time. 
And the father and I have always had custody and they do stay here weekly (he always has to help me to stay calm and not have panic attacks)
I have an appointment, but won’t have meds until July(my baby’s one year month) if I go through them. I can’t miss any more time with them. 
So this is the tough(not rly) choice I’ve made; I’m checking myself back into that facility. It’s two minutes away from my house and I will be there for 3 days to get back on and regulate my meds. I need to get better and be able to regulate myself so I can teach my child how to be a productive member of society, and the caring person I see they will be. 
I’ve also decided to quit vaping, renewing my medical card, and drinking wine. Im BIPOLAR I don’t know how I ever thought I could do these things and be productive. I am almost 3 years clean from hard substances, but im ready to finally detox from it all. Let my mind clear. 
Any encouragement from anyone who’s went through/going through anything similar? Im feeling like a bad mom, but I really want to be better for my baby. I also hope this is comprehensible.

depression,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",doqwow
depression,"Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis","Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are permitted here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

-----

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",1bq9t74
depression,I hate seeing people live their lives,"No hate to people who enjoy their life. But its so depressing to scroll on social media and see people you know going out eating, to concerts, events, and just goofing off with friends. I know social media is fake and their lives also may not be perfect, but they sure as hell aren't laying in bed all day in some old hoodie that they haven't washed in 2 weeks.

depression,"I’m gay, and deep enough in the closet that I’ll probably hang in it","

Never had sex, can’t do it with women due to the lack of attraction, and can’t do it with men due to all the self hate. Don’tfeel much at all anymore, excet hate. Don’t have many friends either, if any.

Ignoring what your body  needs, completely neglecting yourself just because you’re “lazy”. It’s a shit feeling, wasting all your hours on nothing. But still is worrying about yourself and the things around you. For me it’s the overwhelming feeling of having to do something, drives me crazy. I need to brush my teeth, wash my face, take a shower, clean my room, do my homeworks… Yet no matter how hard that want, that itch in your brain to do it. I still can’t, I FUCKING can’t. No matter how hard I try, how bad that feeling to DO IT. I FUCKING CAN’T… and it bothers you… every fucking hour like an alarm clock that couldn’t be turned off.

depression,i’m going to be 24 in august and i feel like i wasted the last 5 years of my life i don’t know what to do ,"im 23 male and my whole 18-23 span of my life i feel like i wasted i’ve been going through anxiety depression and loneliness for years and im so disappointed in myself for just letting life go by.

i know everyone has problems but i feel just so behind i never got to experience anything good in my youth now i feel like im getting too old and i just wish i could go back i just waste my time playing video games on and off working and just listening to music, i found someone i loved last year and got my heart broken and have trust issues now, i dropped out of school when i was 17, i ended up gaining a little bit of weight and i just feel worthless.

sorry for the rant below but i need this weight off my chest.

i dont want to blink and be 40 i want my youth to last but so far it’s been so quick im scared i want to travel, go to college, meet a girl make new experiences but i feel like im too late to start a lot of things maybe its in my head but i need advice because im so lost and depressed 

Every time I watch a movie, I have this sort of pain in my heart as i see a character in a movie being taught by his father to be a man, it makes me desperately wish I had spent my youth learning something instead of gaming and wasting time 

i don't even really know what I want to do. I don't want to be 24. I don't want to have this weight on me. I want to just be me i feel like how i did when i was a kid but with time speeding up on me and being pushed by everyone to do things il never love.

depression,Can’t Commit Suicide ,"I was forced to be a sexual item for the men that belong to my mom’s family from the moment I was born to 15 years old. My mom and brother knew about it and did nothing. My mom’s other family members knew about it and did nothing. 

Why didn’t I do anything? All of these men were older and bigger than me. I had no idea the trauma happened until I realized it at 12 years old. I was confused because these people were supposed to love me and protect me. My mom begged me not to tell anyone, not a single person, of what was happening to me. 

I have severe diagnosed anxiety and major depression. I’m fighting suicidal and homicidal thoughts every day. 

Here’s the thing: I can’t commit suicide. This has nothing to do with my will. It’s because my dad committed suicide and I can’t put my mom and brother through that pain again. I’ve worked past the hatred and resentment I felt for the two of them after long talks during the years that went by after I was 22 years old. 

The trauma still affects me. So I’m living a terrible life, just to be alive for them. I have to be alive for the two people that ruined my childhood. I have to be alive so my friends aren’t sad I’m gone. 

Why do I have to suffer so that others don’t have to suffer? 

Don’t tell me things will get better because they won’t and I won’t explain why. Don’t tell me to go to therapy because I can’t afford it and I truly don’t have the time. Don’t tell me to change my mindset. 

I’m going to keep living a life I don’t want to live, for the sake of others. I’m here to vent, please no advice or criticism ",1cp83pf
depression,Love,I wish I wasn't self aware. To be completely oblivious to all my faults. I'm crazy. I think I fall in love to easily.  Anyway there's this girl. She's absolutely beautiful.

I know she doesn't feel the same though. I keep trying to tell myself that but I can't get her out of my head. My entire day is based on her. If she even talks to me a little bit my mood automatically goes up. If I don't see her at all then it's like my day didn't mean anything. Anyway to get to the point I guess I just don't know what to do. Before I started having feelings for her I was ok I wasn't good but I was getting through it. Now I'm spiraling. It's getting to a point to where I'm going to break and I don't know what I'm gonna do.,1cp7vbk

Someone like me has never, and will never have friends. Never have a relationship. Never know what it feels like to be loved. Never know what it feels like to be wanted. Never know what it's like to be cared for. And its only right, I wouldn't want anything to do with a loser like myself too. Someone who is ugly, dumb, has no friends, or family, or any future prospects. I know people hate me and I dont blame them, I dont expect anyone to not. I just wish I was given the option to choose if I wanted to be born or not if this was the life I was to live. Its cruel to expect anyone to live a life like this. To see others live a fulfilling, satisfying life. Its torture to see others living a life you can only dream of, as all you can do is cry and curse yourself, and nothing more. Hopefully evolution will do its thing and people like me will soon be a long forgotten species. The Earth will only be filled with people with the best genes, looking thier best, living their best life, happy and satisfied. ",1covohf

Back to the beginning of this year, I lost everything that made me excited, from dreams to hobbies that amused me, no longer caring for my health while eating, wishing every night that I don't wake up the next day, and after I spoke of these for the 50th time, my doc made an appointment as video call for my preference, and went on and on about how if I didn't force myself a little for exercise, it wouldn't get better... I said again, how would I do that if I have no will to live, no ambitions, no motivation to go on and would quite literally rather kill myself instead. How he responded? ""Do you want to be hospitalized again?"", turned off the call and went to sleep.

depression,Failed Most of My Classes This Semester; Feeling Worthless,"I'm an 18F college student who just finished her second semester. I basically lost my job and failed the majority of my classes this semester, and withdrew from one. I feel worthless. Last semester I ended with a 3.94 GPA, and my English teacher recommended me to be an English tutor personally. I've struggled with depression all of my life but it never has affected me so badly before. So I failed the English class so I won't be a tutor, I failed math and nutrition (I got C in each but I needed an 80 or above since I'm a nursing major) and I don't know if I'm going to pass microbio. I feel the worst about English because my teacher had so much faith in me and I ruined my opportunity. 

I told my mom but haven't told my dad and he keeps saying how proud of me he is and I feel like a disappointment. I failed because I stopped showing up to class and didn't do the work. I could barely get out of bed and I lost one of my friends, who took it to heart that I ignored her for two weeks even though I was really depressed. I don't even know why I'm depressed, as nothing triggered the event like it has in the past. I'm going back to therapy but I don't know what to do. 

Should I ask my English teacher to retake the class? I really need a job on campus. I'm thinking of retaking math at a community college this summer and transferring the credits. I haven't cried in months, I've just felt numb, but I finally cried for the first time this week but I can't stop. I feel a relapse coming into my ED and SH behaviors and I want to stop it before I do something I regret.

depression,I think that I should just be dead,"First time posting anything so don’t expect a structure or anything else (These are just my thoughts)
I M(19) really think that I should rather just be dead instead of alive. And I just can’t explain it why I‘m feeling this type of way. It’s just that there is a constant emptiness inside of me which is sometimes stronger than at other times. Although I don‘t have many friends, I got many people that still care about me.  I have a loving family that loves and cares about me, a girl that loves me (I don’t deserve her love because I don’t treat her the way which she would deserve), and I‘m also not bad looking (pretty tall [1.90m] and I also get noticed by other girls because of my presence). I noticed that many men in my age are struggling with depression because of their looks and that other women wouldn’t love them because of themselves if that makes sense. But as previously mentioned I don’t have these kind of problems and I just don‘t know why I am still feeling this type of way. I fully believe that the world would be a better place if I wouldn’t exist in it. And therefore I also would rather be dead than alive because I firmly believe, that I do more harm than any good although I know that this isn‘t the case.

depression,"This feeling of loneliness is almost painful.
","I just need to vent. I'm 23M, don't have any 'real' friends, never been in a relationship (never held a woman's hand, etc...). I just feel this constant feeling of loneliness. I feel like it hurts sometimes. Like I can feel this chill in my bones. Hurts me to the core.

What hurts the most is that I know it's all my fault. I let myself get like this. I've been afraid to meet people most of my life. I've been boring to other people, I can't carry most conversation. There's just something wrong with me. I work on myself a fair bit. I've lost a ton of weight, I dress better, graduated college and work a decent job. No matter what I do. I just can't connect with other people. I just don't know how. I don't know what it feels like to connect with someone in a personal level. Friend or otherwise.

Im well aware that I'm not entitled to anything sort of friendship or relationship. But how are you supposed to 'get better' when you're feeling like this? I just feel like I'll be alone forever. I swear I can count on barely two hands the amount of times I've hung out with 'friends' in the last 10 years.

About two months ago I posted here. Two people DM'd me and I thought I was getting along well with both of them. Then one day, I was coincidentally ghosted by both of them. That really hurt. Maybe I was just their own temporary escape from loneliness. But it was crushing to me.

Maybe it'll be better someday. But when it's particularly bad, I feel this almost painful feeling. I hate it so much. This feeling of missing out on social interactions and knowing it's my fault hurts.",1cp52eo

This year has been really rough on my mental health, and for the past three weeks I've had this feeling of complete horror at what seems to be the only possible version of the future. I've long since resolved old struggles with self-harm, and am in no danger of hurting myself.

  
I've been lonely for a long time. There have been points in my life where I've had close friends I can confide in, and I've even been in relationships with several people who genuinely cared for me, at least one of whom was in love with me. When I get lonely I remind myself that many lonely people don't have memories of times like these, and that I'm lucky to have had those experiences at all, even if they're over now. Lately that hasn't been enough though. I wish that somebody knew me.  


My last relationship ended badly 6 years ago. My ex-partner got all of our mutual friends in the breakup. I was left with a group of a few married older male friends who see me as a seat-filler. When they plan a game night but don't have enough people, they invite me to fill in because they know that I don't have a social life and won't say no. They don't think of me as a real person and I can't talk to them about anything real.

He knows what kind of life I've ended up with and I think he wants to feel better about it before he dies. I told him about a board game night I'd been to not long before, hoping that he'd believe everything was fine. I don't want him to worry about me when he's the one dying.  


My doctor gave me some antidepressants after I told him about how I've been feeling lately during a physical last week. I've been taking them as directed for one week now, but nothing's changed yet unless you count the crying. On Wednesday, for the first time in my adult life, I cried. I was sitting in my car in a grocery store parking lot waiting for it to be time to go to work, and I was thinking about how things are going, and I had the feeling of just so badly wanting to speak with someone who cared about me even a little bit and a wave of tears just came pouring out of me and then stopped just as suddenly. It happened again this evening, and once more while I was writing this. I mist up at the end of movies sometimes, but the last time I cried was the fifth grade.  


I don't see any way to adjust this. I've been depressed before, so I know that one of things it does to me is make me think there's no way to make it stop. But when I try to figure out what change I can make to avoid living the rest of my life with this feeling of appalling bleakness, I can't come up with anything. I need friends, but I don't know how to make them. And my mood is too dismal to give it a real attempt. And my appearance is such that other people's first impressions of me are not great.

depression,I don’t like myself,"Hello, 
I 29F feel like I have failed at life completely. 
I’ve struggled with depression, ED, anxiety, religious trauma, and ptsd since as early as I can remember. I always told myself that I was going to finish college and be successful, but none of that happened. I accept that the choices I made in life are what got me here, but I’m just so scared I will never be able to repair it. I graduated 3rd in my class in high school, got into a great college, made A’s for the first year and a half and then it just fell apart. My best friend and the love of my life died of a heroin overdose when I was 19. I never was able to grieve that properly and I ended up flunking out of college, losing my scholarship, and ended up getting into a very emotionally and physically abusive relationship. I got pregnant at 20 by the abusive boyfriend and was able to leave him, but I had to run away and hope that he never found me. I ended up getting married to my now soon to be ex husband when I was 21 while I was 6 months pregnant with my son. (Yes he knew it wasn’t his). We were together up until last month when I finally decided that I couldn’t handle the cheating anymore. My son and I had to move back in with my parents which is a nightmare and I am not ungrateful for them taking us in, but the constant reminder of how I failed and never did anything with my life is killing me. My 20s sucked the life right out of me.

depression,Alright ya'll im signing off.,"No im not ending my life(yet) 

And this is not a rant, (well maybe.)

However i noticed that this sub, or any sub for that matter does nothing for me. I dont want to shame this sub or anything. But what i have noticed that its mainly just kinda like life updates or people who go for advice but hardly get it. Is this really a sub for depression? Or is it just when people are feeling down? Im kinda confused.

However i do understand that alot of people go through things. And i used to check this sub everyday for something. Some motivation, something that will change my worldview and give me the will to live. 

But i often feel worse everytime i check here.
The comparison, its like, ""these people are complaining, yet they got it better than me."" Then what am i? An anomoly, no longer human? Because i stick out even among fellow depressed people. 

And a part of me wants to keep checking here. But i dont think that motivation or anything to change my worldview is coming. Just someone having a midlife crisis or talking about how they feel down because something is not going their way. 

(Again no shade. I promise)

But well, long ass post. Probably going 3/4 in getting ignored here on this sub, but hey....",1cp7uky
depression,Beyond struggling— 35/M,"I just found out Sunday night that my girlfriend of 10 years has been with another guy now for 2 1/2 months. We have lived together for about 9 of those years. Been through our share of ups and downs. We broke up a couple years ago, then just stayed in the same situation, living together, acting like we never broke up. She’s truly likes this guy. Idk how she could move on as fast as she did. Already in the beginning stages of their relationship, dates, sex, everything.

I’m 35 and I’ve never felt anything of this magnitude before, as far as relationships go. We’ve been best friends, and just surrounded by ourselves for so many years.  I Cry myself to sleep every night, then struggle to just get out of bed to go to work. I already got an apartment that Im moving into at the end of the month.

depression,Even death aint worth the sh*t anymore.,"Hey guys, 24m here from nepal and there is something i really want to get off of my chest, it would be pretty long but ig i just need to get it off somehow. Well, i was one of the most bright student during my school time but my family is pretty messed up and now somehow i am the most worthless piece of shit in my whole family. Under my familys demand i did some of the biggest mistake and that mistake made me so miserable and mentally fucked up guy that now even death doesnt scare me.
In the name of helping my family i started taking loans from my friends and relatives at the age of 18 and that debt has piled up so much so that ig i will never be able to pay them off. I work at small coorporate job and my whole income goes at paying the interest of that debt and when i come home after a hard day i want to hear some good things from my family but all i get to witness is family feud. My whole life i have seen my dad and mom fighting each other. People say money cant buy happiness and i know mpney may not be enough to make you feel all the happiness and make you feel complete but money is the most crucial thing to tie your relationahip together. I am at such point of life where i dont even need a second thought to take my life but what after that. Those people from whom i took debt earned it thru their sweat and blood at least before dying i want to pay them off. I just want to vanish from the face of the earth, even my whole existence has been pain and failure. People tell me go for therapy, take medication etc but in my country its so fuckin expensive that i never considered it an option. Everyone says i want to help depressed people bit all i get to hear is their fuckin philosophy, i dont mean to say that those people should pay off my debt but atlest lend those ears sometimes good listener is all you need to make you feel light. Writing this there are million of things going on my mind but i wont be able to all those thing in one go and bore you guys. Well i might be the one at fault here for not trying see life from different perspective and pointing fingers towards everyone but thats how my life has been going on so far.

Today I slept all day because I did not feel like sleeping last night and I did nor wake up until about an hour or so ago. I know that sounds awful and pathetic but I genuinely did not mean to sleep so late and I had no idea that I slept so late. I am feeling so depressed because of that. Today I feel super weird and lightheaded like I'm detached maybe. Everything feels so far away that it is almost unreal. Everything just feels so far away and I don't like that feeling at all. I'm in an unbelievable fog.

depression,What the actual fck is going on with my life? 21 years old,"Life's a shitshow. Literally for my entire life I wanted to be a game tester. Being a kid I was told there were people that could live off of playing video games. Drop out of college (didn't have enough money to pay for it), learned some English and became a game tester in Mexico City. Now I'm 21 years old and I'm so fuckin miserable. Quitting and getting back to my parents house. They live in a different city called Mérida, the weather is, and I kid you not, literal hell. Back in Mexico City I had to maintain my calm because of some awful abusive family members. Drama here and drama there. Can't stand it any longer. My own 12 year old sister mocking me for dropping out and not being able to get a job in this bullshit city, where minimum wage is around 6,000 mexican pesos (around 400 dollars per month). Man, I'm so tired. There's nowhere I can go to. That job was the only proper thing I had. My girlfriend left me for a dude she met at college, build like a stick, and they started a relationship just one week after knowing each other. We were together for about 4 years. I'm gaining some weight. Nothing seems to be interesting anymore and I'm starting to have rage problems. The only hope I see is to learn Chinese (which for some reason is very well payed here lol) and become a translator in that language. That could take a few years, but after evaluating various ways of escaping this depressing life, that seems the only way to survive. If I can't have that then I guess I'm offing myself. ",1cp6pb6

Now, I am a shell of that person. An absolute shell. I’m suicidal about 3 days a month and I feel that I have a pretty solid plan but I play it out to the point where my kids find out I’m dead and I can’t do that to them. Last summer I cried when I found out that the golf ball lump in my throat was just a cyst. I figured that my kids couldn’t get mad at me if I had to die of cancer and I could just spend the next year numbed up on morphine and it would be over soon enough, which it will be anyway, for all of us.

depression,A confession,"I (19F) think I've been going back into deep depression again.   
1-2 years ago I got myself a therapist. It's helped these past years, but as were starting 2024 I feel like now, I've been lying to my therapist of how I really feel. I would really only tell them about the drama I get with friends and family and not truly say what I wanna say.   
I feel as though lately with how things have been spiraling and with finals week, things just arent going how I wish they went. Lately I feel as though one of my friends are drifting away after a small argument we had. I went to go see her at class (since we go to the same college and thankfully I know where her class is) and I was worried something happened since she hasnt texted me. I felt as though when she saw me she wanted to walk away or avoid me but I persisted because I really was worried. When we got to our cars we were joking and talking how we usually do, but after we left I felt like my stomach was turning and I wanted to throw up..  
Another incident is lately I feel so put off by my cousin. I realize how much I really look up to her (20f) and I guess Ive been wanting to impress her too..Just lately when we interact It feels so distant. It feels like sometimes Im forcing myself just to be able to interact with her now. I do well with talking to her friends since theyre my friends now too, but when Im with her I feel like im in the background. Lately I feel like sometimes its hard to just be her friend now. She always says im her best friend..  
I lost a friend a month back, im talking less to people Ive met online, ive been getting more high lately, and I feel like just giving up again. I dont want to, but I feel like sometimes that's my only option.   
I know maybe these scenarios are silly and Ill just be dying for nothing if I went through with it, but Idk I guess I just needed to put it out there that Im not doing okay",1cp60ve
depression,"I no longer wish to live, but am too afraid to die.","I'm 36. My depression and anxiety have put a strain on my relationship with my partner over the last couple of years, we've been together for over 10 years.

I am also an alcoholic. After years of sobriety, I relapsed last summer. This began a year where I would be sober for a few weeks to months, then relapse for a day or two. This caused a lot of stress with my partner, and after many last chances, she walked out the door a couple of weeks ago. I wasn't abusive, angry, or manipulative, but the lying the loss of trust and her worry about me became too much for her.

I haven't drank since she left, I go to meetings every day. Finally started therapy to deal with my other issues. But she is still gone... if I had started these things last year, she would still be here.

I am worse off than I was before. I can get out of bed in the morning, only doing so to do the bare minimum for my job and to take care of our dog.... I don't see a reason to go.

I cannot picture myself not being able to buy my lady anything that she's ever wanted. All of my friends have their high school sweethearts or have a bunch of women lined up to talk to them. I want that love. I want that attention. If I am not doing something extremely hard I end up thinking about how far behind I am from everyone. If I died there would be nothing left of me. My parents wouldn't have made a profit off of me and I would've just been a financial burden for these past 20 years. I can't cry. I'm far passed that. I often find myself distracting myself from this sadness with work. I don't know how to address it. I don't know if the only way to heal it is to get someone because if that's the case I am going to have to wait another seven years at least. I want that young love. I want to have someone that wants me and only me. I want to feel them run their fingers through my hair. I want to feel the weight of their hand in mine. I want to feel the warmth of their body when we're close. When will this end. Why did this have to happen to me? On top of all of this, I am here begging for change on a computer in my parents home while some kids don't have parents, they won't ever have love, they can't come home to someone that loves them, and I am here crying about my little stupid situation so I feel even worse.

BipolarReddit,Welcome to BipolarReddit! A Message from the Community,"Welcome! This is a community focused on supporting people diagnosed with bipolar disorder. If you are bipolar, we’re glad you’re here. We are a judgement-free community that wants to see all people diagnosed with bipolar disorder achieve enduring health and balance. 

As you explore the discussions, here is a primer on how this community works.

* Most people who post and comment on r/BipolarReddit have already received a medical diagnosis, including bipolar type 1, type 2, schizoaffective or cyclothymia. If you have not yet sought a diagnosis, we encourage you to meet with a doctor, discuss your concerns and solicit their diagnosis. However, you are welcome to read and ask general questions in your pursuit of health.  
* A medical diagnosis can only be given by a medical professional. If you are concerned enough about your mental health to ask if you are bipolar, that is sufficient reason for you to seek a medical opinion. None of us participate here in a medical capacity, and no one here can or will tell you if you are bipolar. Those kinds of questions are not for this subreddit.
* We like to be precise. Terms like mania, hypomania and major depression have specific definitions, and we ask you to familiarize yourself with the medical terminology. We have created a wiki for (and authored by) people with bipolar disorder, based on the DSM-V. Please [review the definitions](https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/wiki/index/definitions). **Important Note:** The terms mania and hypomania are often conflated, inaccurately. Please be exact in your use of these terms when posting and commenting because it helps the community understand the severity of what you are experiencing, which helps us give you the best support. Mania is a medical emergency that typically requires hospitalization. We understand that it can be hard to know exactly what is going on in the moment. Just do your best so we can better understand you. 
* We invite you to [explore the rest of our subreddit’s wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/wiki/index), which has valuable information and resources this community has compiled. There are some common questions for people with bipolar disorder. Before posting a question, please look through the wiki to see if your question has already been answered.  
* Harassment is not tolerated, and this subreddit is actively moderated. Do not post anything that is hateful or hurtful to others’ path to health. Robust discussion and strong opinions are most welcome, but keep it kind. If you see harassment, report the post or comment and use the “Message the Mods” button with any background information, if you have it. Please do not engage. We will get to it as quickly as we can. 
* If you are not bipolar, you may want to visit r/BipolarSOs or related subreddits. This is not a place to discuss bipolar on behalf of someone else or seek opinions on whether someone else is bipolar. The one exception is if you have an urgent help question and need a fast answer (e.g., “My SO is diagnosed bipolar and is currently psychotic, what do I do?”). 
* We don’t do memes, art or other popular media. Such posts will be removed. We are purely focused on support through discussion.",kr9uh4

I document every episode I have because I noticed I was doing this (forgetting). It's the forgetting that I think makes some of us go off of our medications. It's as if we believe they are no longer a factor in our lives. Can you relate? Documenting gives me something concrete to look at to remind myself of why I am on meds to begin with.

BipolarReddit,Welp.,"I made a post yesterday asking how you tell the difference between hypomania and mania. I may be hypomanic based on how people are talking. 🤔 It seems like every time I feel relatively normal everyone says things about me.

People tell me I've been acting ""off"" or ""weird"" and that I'm ""having crazy ideas"". To me these ideas all seem justified. I've seen multiple reddit posts on here that have to do with topics I thought about myself or mentioned to my online friends. Really specific topics and I'm not sure if it's a coincidence.

I'm not even sure if anything I've been experiencing is a coincidence. Things have been happening and pretty much confirming what I've been thinking. Like is it a coincidence that a song came on from my Playlist about being free as soon as I started my car to go somewhere new?

I've seen posts and comments about people wanting, or trying, to leave and start a new life and for them they said it was an episode but I feel like for me it makes sense. I need a new clean slate where nobody knows me or my issues. I've genuinely been debating doing this but now I probably can't because I've told my SO about the plan.

I did leave my nurse practitioner a message like people suggested but I'm not even sure how much I want to follow the advice she'll probably give me since I'm pretty sure everyone just wants me drugged up and ""under control"" which is why I want a fresh start.

Maybe I am hypomanic, but if I am it genuinely makes me want to run away even more or even just end myself to be honest. 🥲",1cowysd

I’m struggling because my job can be incredibly demanding and stressful and I’m finding myself questioning a career change. I’m currently an interior designer. So most of my work is client and deadline driven. 

People around me don’t understand what mania is like…I literally forgot to let my coworkers know I was out because I wasn’t myself anymore. I wish there was more surrounding mental health awareness overall.

BipolarReddit,"Actually, I do have to take these meds *forever*","It gets frustrating sometimes. I'm decently open about my mental health with friends. But sometimes I'll make a comment about medication I take. Usually cause said friend brings up alcohol. And I respond saying I can't drink. They usually ask why and I say it's cause my meds. And the well meaning friends will be like ""hey at least it's not forever"" 

Like I get that most people in their 20s don't take regular daily medication. But I do. And bipolar doesn't just ""go away"" if you treat it for a year. It's forever. 

I never know how to react. Usually I gut react with ""unfortunately, yes it is forever"" and then the friend looks uncomfortable.

I hate that drinking is such a common social thing. And I tried it once on these meds and I'll never make that mistake again. But also can't I just say ""I don't drink"" without getting badgered with questions?

Like even before I had a bipolar diagnosis. Back when it was just labeled ""depression"" people would always talk with this expectation that eventually I'd get off my meds. Not everyone's brain can just function properly without help. I wish more people understood than mental illness isn't just a passing one time thing that you can just ""get over"" 

People don't go around telling my sister to stop taking her heart medication. But because mine is for my brain, it's fair game for comments by people who have zero understanding of the issue.

BipolarReddit,Alternatives to lamictal?,"Hey everyone. I was on lamictal for 13 days and woke up with a random rash on my thumb (I can attach pictures if anyone cares), so as a precaution, both my psych and I decided to stop taking it and monitor the rash (it's gotten a bit bigger. Yes, I'm heading to urgent care once my husband gets home in 2 hours bc I have kids. I just don't want to sit in the ER for 4+ hours again until they can see me while sitting around in a petri dish of the flu and norovirus)

That being said, on my initial appointment, I was given the option of Seroquel. Based on what I'm reading, and the fact is have 2 young children I am the primary care giver of for 12+ hrs a day while my husband works, I don't think that will be a good fit due to the heavy sedation effects.

BipolarReddit,Hypomania from Wellbutrin but didn't realize it at all?,"Hi, so I was put on 150mg Wellbutrin and 8mg Perphenazine at the same time about a year and a half ago leading to this year where I had my first real depressive episode in a long while after a ton of big life events happened and after my Wellbutrin was raised I started becoming more and more manic within the span of a couple days, like day 2 getting a couple hours of sleep and being alert, cleaning the house and sending crazy texts. Which made me realize I think I've been cycling in and out of hypomania the entire time I've been taking it and did not realize it. I haven't had a therapist to check in with and I have no idea how I didn't realize it, I'm really genuinely ashamed but I did things like pursue my housing advisor at a seasonal job I randomly signed up for, moved across country on a whim, spent basically all the money I was earning at the beginning of this year before I became depressive, possibly scared off a few friends because I became very vocal and intense about something that I had never really cared about or felt that way about prior but I was being sure to get normal sleep during this so I never thought it was hypomania. My new psych took me off the Wellbutrin altogether after I became manic and it's been so different. Like the racing thought loops and anxiety just stopped and I've just been existing like normal again. When I first started this medication I thought it was a lifesaver, I really loved being on it but now I'm not so sure at all, and I'm curious if anybody has had similar experiences.",1coyypc

BipolarReddit,"Do you ever run out of one med, then just stop taking the others? because you feel like they’re supposed to all work together and there would be no point?","I ran out of everything except Depakote. I felt like that wouldn’t help on its own anyway so I hadn’t been taking it. I started it again a couple days ago because I was feeling really bad and anxious and I was willing to try anything in the house that would calm me down. Except for alcohol.

I’m on the mend currently from my last bender ending March 4th. I’ve been doing good, but my compromise to my husband so I didn’t have to do residential was that I would “rehab” myself at my mom’s house. Doing an IOP at my psych clinic with an LCDC (which is basically holistic therapy anyway). I refuse AA because the closest meeting I’ve already slept with a few people there over the years and it makes me cringe..

Anyway, my point about the depakote is my anxiety has gone down, and I have a little more control over my moods. I have an appointment with the doctor on Friday (tried to do a walk in but got frustrated after 4 hours) and I’ll be officially back on all my meds! I really feel like this is a good day. I feel optimistic about IOP and I think I can be happy when I move back in with my husband into the new house. My life is looking good from my view. On paper my life is ruined (criminal record, no work history besides stripping for 10 years, 270 credit score, more debt than I’ll ever pay off so I just don’t try). It’s all about mindset. I have a beautiful family, smart kids, cute animals, housing, food, sisters and a brother. I have everything a person could want.

BipolarReddit,I’ve been diagnosed for 11 years.  Today was the first day I’ve ever felt my medication was correct,"Hey Reddit

If you’re in your early stages, I don’t say that to scare you.  I post this to say, it’s completely possible to get on the right meds.  You just have to take them on schedule and consult with your doctor on changes that need to be made

I haven’t felt comfortable in my entire life, but I’m now at a place where I not only feel truly stable, but I feel like I have hope and can succeed 

I was in a in patient hospital only a little less than four months ago at rock bottom.  I never believed I’d be in the hospital for a second time (suicide attempt in college) and when I got out, I was showering 5-10 times a night and was sleeping outside on my back porch because I was being tormented by anxiety.

I was at a job where every shift the night before I’d have a full blown panic attack and now I drive to my new job with a smile on my face ready to face the day.

I just want to share and say

Living a life without psychosis is possible.  Living a stable life is possible.  You just need your do what you need to do to take the steps to take care of yourself

If you need meds, take them on time and realize every medication takes time.

Don’t loose your hope.

I can say, personally, things can get incredible for you, just if you have this illness, you HAVE to push yourself to take care of yourself.  It will take way more effort to you than any average person can understand 

But if you keep trying, work with your doctor, and do everything you can to take care of your health even if that means you can handle the bare minimum that day, 

Slowly 

It is possible to feel okay

I felt nothing changed, I was devoid of any emotion/dissociating/awful episodes ranging from isolation to extremely reckless behaviour with drugs, getting arrested, sex and binge drinking to name a few.

After speaking to my psychiatrist further, she diagnosed me with bipolar and was put on lamotrigine along with my antidepressants. I feel slightly more stable and I’m not going from 0-100 as before. My habits have changed, I’m no longer taking substances/binge drinking etc. From January to mid April, I was more productive at work, although I spent loads of money from buying books and read over 100 in less than 3 months (I haven’t picked up a book for years prior to this), not feeling the need to sleep because I want to keep reading. It makes me feel amazing because I’m so focused on it rather than spending my time on unhealthy habits as before. Of course I still have absolute shit days where basic human routines are out of the window. 

Over the past week it’s been an absolute chore to pick up a book, I haven’t been to work in 2 weeks and I barely leave the house unless I’m going to my boyfriends’ place. Looking back, I’m now wondering if I was in a manic/hypomanic episode during those months or just a change in habits? Any advice would be great, thank you! xx",1connkd

I am currently on a low dose of lamotrigine (generic version of lamictal) and have been taking it since December of last year. We had to work slowly to increase my dosage bc moving too fast caused increased suicidal thoughts and irritability. 

At first I felt like I was making progress and my moods started to feel less extreme between highs and lows. But lately I am feeling as if the meds are not doing anything for me at this point, other than feeling more heightened anxiety and tiredness. However, my psychiatrist said the anxiety could be stemming from other life situations I have going on. I am just not sure which it is. 

So she recommended maybe switching to Latuda, if anyone has experiences on this med if you can share your thoughts/how it’s worked for you?

BipolarReddit,Yeah I am bipolar. Not stupid and I'm sick of the bullies irl. Venting. ,"So I have been going to dbsa meetings on zoom for a while now. And I have noticed, because I'm not stupid, that there are quite a few imposters and Pretenders in those groups. The only reason I can figure that they are there is to troll mentally ill people.

 I cannot understand or wrap my brain around the type of person who will do this but I have come up with a profile. They are generally millennials and they never self-identify as bipolar. In fact they will say the complete opposite, either that they are unipolar with major depressive disorder, or that they have schizoaffective disorder.

 Anything but bipolar disorder. In other words they really don't belong in those meetings but because dbsa doesn't discriminate they are allowed in and they seem to gather information on other members. Moreover, they seem to want to be friends outside the group, get close to people, use their personal share time to intentionally trigger others and so on. 

Now one could say that I'm just being manic or that I am delusional because I do in fact have bipolar disorder. And it would be plausible because I self-identify as bipolar and the whole scenario is designed to have plausible deniability built into it. 

And what kind of a****** would I be if I actually called someone out on it during a meeting? I would be accused of picking on the another person, a person who is quote suffering and quote.

If anyone can provide insight into the question at the end please do but here's a little set up. 'm currently a patient in hospital, Bipolar 2 with a depressed baseline that sinks extra low in episodes and is treatment resistant, PMDD, anxiety and other things. I've been having severe suicidal ideations and have been on the edge of acting that out so I went to the hospital. I contracted Covid while in the ED and have been in isolation for 4 days now which hasn't helped things.

I had an encounter with a nurse working overnight being unbelievably hostile towards me because I asked for water. It's a whole thing and I've submitted a complaint but won't get into here. But it felt like confirmation that I am in fact a burden to anyone near me which pushed me over that edge. I put a bag around my head, my first attempt ever but that defensive reflex activation kicked in and I survived.

Anyway, when my doctor found out he seemed mad, and essentially told me if I did anything like that again, attempts or any self harm that l'd be immediately discharge and I'm so confused as +n why and hoping someone could clarify.

BipolarReddit,Hypomanic vs manic?,"Wanting some input on how you, personally, can tell if you've gone from hypomanic to manic? I'm really not sure how to tell the difference between hypomania and mania in my own personal life. 



Someone suggested to me that I may be in an elevated episode. They said ""manic"" but I don't think I would qualify as manic, barely even hypomanic.

Some things I mentioned were that my libido is maybe towards the highest it's been, I've been sleeping less at night (but making myself take naps during the day to balance out), hyperfixating on a restarted hobby (could be ADHD), and I also find myself doing things that I'm not sure why or even what I'm actually doing. I haven't told anyone this part, but there were a couple times in the past few days where I thought something that happened to me was a sign I was doing the right thing and found myself listening to songs ""waiting for a message""...

The part about not knowing what I'm doing is like, I got to work early then a few minutes before time to clock in I sent a message saying I couldn't be there (said personal emergency) and left. I went home and packed a bag but I wasn't sure where I was going or how long, I just wanted to go somewhere. I also was semi thinking hypothetically (semi serious) about just disappearing and starting a new life, even made the conscious decision to leave my dog behind because I knew it would be suspicious if both of us were gone. I told my SO about this and they were not amused and said they don't think I should. Before, they had used our joint bank account to track me down during other episodes so this time I was planning on using my own personal credit card so it would be easier.

I think really I'm just feeling too tied down and that all of this stuff is holding me back from who I am actually supposed to be.

I've also been swinging from feeling like this to having some SI when it feels like people are suggesting I'm hypomanic (even though they say there aren't meaning that).

I guess it makes a difference (maybe?) if I mention that I recently had a med change and decreased my Rexulti dosage from 4mg to 3mg a couple weeks ago.",1cod79o
BipolarReddit,Is this mania? ,"Is this mania?

So… last September I broke up with my partner after being with him for almost 9 years. We’ve had our fair share of ups and downs. But this was my last straw. I became numb and didn’t love him anymore. September and October months were fine for me, and then came November. I was still living with my ex at the time, but I’d met someone on tinder and went to his house to sleep with him. This happened twice (unsafe sex). I don’t know what came over me, I felt “free” but I’ve never ever had a casual hook up like that. I felt very promiscuous and would do anything to please this hook up. I even lent him £100 which everyone told me not to but I did it anyway. They were right because I only saw £30 back. I’d come back dressed in skimpy clothes from walking home from his at night time might i add. I felt so free and so sexy and I could now sleep with loads of people. 

I got fully into music. I’d never been that into music before, I’d come back from work and listen to music through my headphones on full volume for hours and hours sometimes playing the same song more than 20 times. Whereas normally I’d just watch something and lay in bed. I’d post constantly on social media, take nudes etc. dropped hundreds on festival tickets and gigs and clothes which wasn’t like me, I  even had another relationship with a guy who was toxic in the end, I only broke up with him after getting a tattoo which helped snap me out of things a bit.

All the while my ex was constantly worried about me. He said I was unwell and acting crazy. I said screw you at the time. Anyway fast forward until now and I’m finally feeling like myself again. I don’t have interest in sex or doing impulsive things atm. My ex was by my side the whole time. We went for a meal the other day and he had told me his mum who is a health professional told him I was manic and that it would last a few months from what she had seen when she last saw me. She’s known me 9 years so could tell the signs I wasn’t right. Anyway something snapped and I now feel love towards my ex again, we are now together again. 

My question is… does this sound like mania to you or was I just free from a long term relationship? I also get paranoid thoughts that my ex was trying to make me crazy and his mum is too so I’d get back with him. But I know that’s irrational?

BipolarReddit,"Partially unmedicated temporarily during a stressful life period and losing it, what do you do for me time? ","Unfortunately I had an allergic reaction to one of the mood stabilizers I was on, but one that was helping. My psych had me stop immediately and wait until our next appt to discuss alternatives so the allergic reaction could clear.  But like, immediately after, a pet died, my husband had changes at work where he is temporarily working like 80 hours a week, so all the childcare and household stuff is on me, I am planning a family trip (pre planned) basically solo - and just, a lot of other stressors are getting dumped on me during this unstable med time. 

I am seeing the next week - but in the mean time, I'm kinda losing it. My therapist said I needed to somehow find 1-2 hours a day to take me time (get my mom to watch the kids (complicated) idk?)....but...what can I do aside from sit in a quiet room alone or go on a walk?

schizophrenia,What do you think caused schizophrenia for you?,"I assume someone or some people in my family must have had schizophrenia down the line. But it was likely hidden, like all mental illnesses back in the day

One thing I noticed in a schizophrenia support group is how absolutely self involved the mothers are about the situation. They don't seem to feel any empathy for their child's situation and are only focused on themselves. I grew up with a narcissistic mother whose love was conditional. My dad was worse.

I did smoke pot and dabble in festival drugs but nothing crazy. I think it was mostly the combo of genetics and childhood trauma that caused it for me.

What about you guys? Anyone have a thought on why this happened to them?",1cp37g5

schizophrenia,Schizophrenia Awareness and Stigma,"As you probably know, the main group of people victimized by lobotomies and historical asylums are us. But for some reason, people tend to forget that. 

Autism in recent years has grown into the public eye and has mostly been 
de-stigmatized. It has not been done with schizophrenia however. We’re still seen as a violent, unemployable, crazy group of people. 

I’ve had a friend ask if I was schizophrenic and not wanting to lie and trusting them I said yes. They never talked to me again.

The illness is a part of me, it makes me who I am it’s what made me stronger and I’m proud of who I am and that’s just how our brains are made. However I feel horrible for existing too.

But in autism I’ve also seen it be popularized and “cool” and every second kid is diagnosing themselves with it. If this happened to schizo, it would most likely go down a similar path especially since it’s “edgier”. This personally bothers me as someone without the same experiences but using the label as a way to feel special appropriates the illness. 

My question is; do you think schizophrenia should be in the public eye?

Bonus question: do you think schizo is a slur?",1coykfk

schizophrenia,How do you guys deal with Ideas of References? (Explanation in description),"Ideas of References are delusions caused by or causing thoughts that innocuous stuff from the outside world is referring to you. It could be:

- thinking the TV is talking to you

- thinking a billboard is a sign to guide you

- overhearing a conversation and thinking that they're talking about you

- that things are code for you or about you

What are some examples you have?

The **Default Mode Network** of the brain has overcennectivity and hyperactivity, being on most the time, which is responsible for *self-referential thinking*, as well as daydreaming or mind-wandering. Parts of the brain that are included in this network are the **dorsal medial prefrontal cortex** (I'm guessing contributes to the abstract cognitive flexibility of schizophrenia), **posterior cingulate cortex** (greater size means less working memory), **precuneus** (greater self-consciousness and reflection), and the **angular gyrus** (my guess would be that this contributes to the hardships of accurately reading in schizophrenia, as well as why we make alternative meanings to words (code), make up words, susceptible to form-priming, and have distorted symbolic interaction).

A lower **PPI (Prepulse Inhibition)** of schizophrenics means that it's *harder to filter out unimportant stimuli*, and that you get startled by or at least pay more attention to innocuous stimuli.

Hyper connectivity and activity of the DMN coupled with a lower PPI, plus the diminished reasoning abilities from the prefrontal cortex, are what causes Ideas of References.

For me, it took a lot of studying and CBT to suppress these, and now I'm mostly symptom free! Still though, there are times where it bothers me. How do you guys deal with it?",1cp6f0l

schizophrenia,I think I might be schizophrenic ,"For the past 2 years I've been having increased schizophrenic-ish thoughts. Sorry about the way I word things I really don't know how to explain what I'm going through. Throughout my life I've always been a shy guy with bad anxiety and terrible speaking abilities. I've always had a hard time meeting new people and making friends, but the friends I did make became real easy to talk to. Throughout my highschool time I always had a feeling someone was making fun of me or talking behind my back if they weren't talking directly at me. My mind always took phrases and I guess ""rewired"" them into kind of backhanded insults when someone was talking around me no matter who or what they were talking about I would even picture them talking in a 3rd person pov as soon as they started talking even when I was not facing them. It seemed so real like a cctv footage. I knew that when I was younger that is was just my mind/anxiety getting the best out of me at the time. When I was in my senior year of highschool I went to this party in the woods and got way to high. All the noise and shit fucked me up real bad I started to get really anxious I kept asking my friends if people were talking about me. I kept on hearing people in the background talking about me but my friends didnt hear anything. These are my best friends and I know they would never try to induce me into a bad trip. I was seeing shadows around me and again creating a 3rd person perspective in my head of everyone talking about me. I know its my mind fucking with me. Now that I'm older it's alot harder to ignore stuff like this. Words, phrases, and laughter. I feel like there laughing at me, making a joke out of me. I know they're not it's just my mind, but I dont realize it at the time, It's affecting me at work real bad. I few months ago someone attempted a cartel scam on me. Shook me up real bad and now things out of the ordinary like my pc being hacked. My car headlight wires being cut. They were cut in a malicious way. I mean clean straight cuts. I don't know if it's the cartel messing with me or my mind playing tricks on me putting stuff Unrelated together. I don't know if this is schizophrenia or something else.

I’ve been getting super easily overstimulated (I get overstimulated a lot but now it’s way worse), and whenever someone starts talking to me, I feel like I can’t think. If they say more than a sentence or two, I feel like my head is going to explode trying to process the information and think of a response and I find myself getting very irritated and snapping at them.

schizophrenia,My Experience w Schizophrenia and Catatonia ,"It’s been a hard ass life for sure.

I’ve had 11+ hospitalizations between the ages of 12-16. I haven’t been in the hospital for while now (yay!) and I would like to keep it that way.

I haven’t really been on too on top of meds, I take them on and off and is more of a problem with remembering and having the motivation to. (Abilify)

Day to day breakthrough symptoms I can manage it’s just the cognitive ones I struggle with the most. I had to drop out of Highschool because I physically could not stay on top of classes and had a over 60% missing attendance rate in grades 10-12. I now work full time at a aquarium shop and I am now a young adult. I was diagnosed when I was around 17. 

I cannot read more than one book page at a time which inhibits me from perusing university. I originally wanted to become a exotic vet because of my love for animals but instead had to watch all my friends graduate as I got held back year after year. This illness has single-handedly destroyed my life. Despite all this I still appreciate everything that I have and that I can even maintain a job! 

I deal with all the traditional symptoms but my working memory and executive functioning is so low I find myself spending hundreds of dollars on a whim, going into credit card debt, and not being able to remember names and faces. 

One other more unique symptoms is catatonia which is so embarrassing because it can be hard to hide. It usually manifests under stress and as thinking you can move but your brain and body feel disconnected so you can’t. If anyone else out there has experiences w Catatonia, please share.

Thanks for reading.

schizophrenia,My mother just doesn’t get it,"I’m currently diagnosed with schizotypal, but my symptoms have been getting worse, so I’m asking for a second opinion today. I think my doctor of 5 years is afraid to give me the schizophrenia diagnosis due to it potentially ruining my self image or idk. But he has said I fit into the schizophrenia criteria, he’s just not willing to give me the diagnosis. So second unbiased opinion it is.

I told my mother about it (I’m 23) and she got all disapproving of it. She’s very spiritual and potentially delusional. She thinks I’m a medium who has powers and organs to communicate with other worldly beings and ghosts. She thinks I just have hearing issues instead of having auditory hallucinations. She thinks I want to be schizophrenic and I have talked myself into it and if only I wanted to be healthy I wouldn’t run after a diagnosis. She thinks in one of my past lives I’ve suffered due to being healthy, so my soul chose to be sick in this lifetime and I have to figure out why to elevate and cure myself.

schizophrenia,I think my disorder is all my fault,"Since birth and most my childhood, i was a very angry and violent child, i would bang my head constantly, i would often threaten to take my life at the age of 6 (i doubt i would of done it back then), i used my wellbeing as leverage over teachers, therapist, doctors, and my family. I started taking mood stabilizers for Bipolar disorder as a toddler and never stopped being on medications since, and every med would stop working after a year or two.

In my early teen years i was a lot better than i was before with rare self harm. then when i turned 14 i started doing basic drugs, slowly started moving to more hardcore drugs such as oxy, morphine, spice, and then got to almost every drug in the book including Benadryl, i only showed up at my house at night to go right back to bed and as a manipulative child i could easily play off a lot of stuff i was doing (they knew something was up but not at the degree it was). over 3, 8 mental hospitals, multiple withdraws, self harm, purposeful concussions, and putting myself in traumatic situations, and drugs that were known for really messing you up

at 16 i was diagnosed with acute psychosis and from there it continued to get worse, and part of me wanted to become worse from guilt from some unknown reason.

i am 18 now and clean from every illegal drug i am diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, and i am 2 months away from being accepted for SSI(disability) I am filled with guilt that my mother has had to take care of me after my father gave up on me. My mom should not be taking care of me, my mom should not be scared of me, My mom should not be signing my rights away to her when im 18. I am trapped, i am unfunctional in any situation no matter the meds im on. Where do i go from here, ive been in my room for over a year while my body rots away.

Anxiety,Anyone else feel like they are suddenly starving and/or aroused during when they get relief from anxiety?,"When I get the perfect reassurance that makes me feel like everything is gonna be okay, I suddenly feel my stomach being super hungry like my body is just remembering it needs to eat. I also sometimes feel quite ""horny"" like my body suddenly remembers it has a sex drive. It's like those functions were muted so long that they come back with a vengeance once the anxiety is gone. Has anyone else felt this?

I hear of people eating more when anxious but for me it's the opposite. ",1cp0buw
Anxiety,Movies that give you anxiety?,"Anyone else have movies that give them anxiety? I don't mean movies with tense scenes or ones that may contain triggers, more so the thought of them or imagery makes you feel anxious? I recently saw a YouTube video easy on a old horror movie I saw a few times as a kid. It freaked me out so much back then, yet I remember watching it multiple times. Whenever I see parts of it or think about it enough to start imagining scenes from it in my head, I feel super anxious and on edge. Pit in my stomach, nausea, super jumpy, the works. The funny thing is, I'm a MASSIVE horror buff nowadays. Halloween and horror in general is practically part of my DNA as an adult. I would always see bits and pieces of other horror movies growing up, and then watch them years later when I was older and they would become some of my favorite movies ever. Its just this one movie. I've tried to watch it again in my adult life to ""conquer my fear"", so to speak, but got so freaked out and anxious I could barley sleep that night. 

  
Anyone else have feelings like this? Super curious to find out.",1cp5dna
Anxiety,Am I in the right sub ?,"* Increased heart-rate for no reason (100+ bpm while doing jack-shit)
* Ice-cold sweaty hands
* Tingling/tense muscles
* Twitching muscles
* Shortness of breath
* Sometimes hard to swallow my own saliva  


And this happens without any specific reason at all, and suddenly. I had absolutely 0 issues like this before COVID... Nada, never knew what anxiety or depression is, and I was extremely healthy (actually I still think I am, but I just feel like a heart-attack is imminent).  


So, is this the right sub for these symptoms ?

Anxiety,How to get over fear of cancer? ,"I can deal with the thought of getting sick at times. I cannot deal with the thought of getting cancer. 

It's so tough reading some news articles of a newly happily married couple, and then the husband or wife gets told they have one year to live because of an aggressive cancer.

I don't know how I would cope if that was me. It's just such a scary thought. Seeing yourself or your partner dying slowly from cancer and all the pain that comes with it. Knowing that they only have 2 months left to live etc. 

I'm so terrified I will get cancer one day. It causes me anxiety nearly every day. 

How can I get over this fear of cancer? ",1conns0
Anxiety,Can a sedentary lifestyle develop an anxiety disorder?,"Cuz that's the only reason I can think of as to why i have it, like just sitting around a lot made my brain anxious or whatever ",1covx80
Anxiety,Have you ever felt anxiety keeps the maximum potential of you suppressed?,"Also what happens if you're constantly reminded and faced with the trigger for your anxiety. Life you know what you're capable of and have shown it before,but ever since anxiety you can't do it again. Do you just accept it or try to overcome it.if yes ,how?",1coou52
Anxiety,"If traditional therapy hasn't been working for you, are you just out of luck?","All I ever see about anxiety treatment is cognitive behavioral therapy this, CBT that. But I've been through several therapists who all use that same therapy modality and I really just don't find that it's been all that effective for me. Knowing my anxiety is irrational hasn't made it go away. Also, the relaxation therapy exercises they often incorporate alongside it only work to an extent. Is that all there is for anxiety therapy? Am I just stuck repeating this process over and over again?",1cosdd5
Anxiety,How tf do you make friends in your 30s??,"Especially as an introvert..and when you have anxiety. I went to an art auction at a gallery that my friend runs. I paid 40$ for a ticket and left after an hour. I didn't even go to the after-party. There was a sea of people there, and I felt like literally the only person there alone. Just a bunch of couples and groups of people. It was awkward af. My anxiety kicked in and I had to bail. And I had on an amazing outfit and perfume I had been waiting to wear. My friend's friend whom she mentioned a while ago had a bit of a crush on me and came over to say hello and ask me a few things, but she went back to her friends from out of town and I was alone again.

I like art, horror films, weird music, poetry, video games, anime, hiking, fashion, festivals, concerts, etc. I have interests, but these seem like things you do with people you already know, not places to meet new people. They're always full of couples and groups.

No matter where I go, I never meet anyone, and I'm always the one alone. it's like it's not possible to meet new people. I'm 31, and nothing I do ever leads to making new friends...I'm not even sure why I made this post, but I've been trying really hard this year to make new friends after distancing myself from my old group, and I have made no progress. The friend I made from volunteering at an art gallery is a woman...and virtually all her friends are women, and despite how nice she is and how she tries to incorporate me into her circle, I'm never going to fit bc I'm just too different.

I already can't date...it would be nice to at least have some friends...

How tf does someone in their 30s with anxiety who isn't outgoing actually make friends?",1cot3m3
Anxiety,Does anyone else have anxiety so bad it brings suicidal thoughts? ,"Does anyone else have this? I'm working with a therapist but my anxiety is so bad at times that it feels like it goes from 0 to 100 and from okay to ""I need to d!e immediately."" It's unbearable and exhausting to feel like every mistake, every fear, every anxiety provoking thought, all of it triggers this unbearable escalation. Has anyone else had this happen? ",1cp6355
Anxiety,Just a vent- fuck you anxiety. Fuck you ADHD. ,"Im doing ok, but shit I could have way many more friends, done way better in life, if it wasn’t for awkward social interactions because of ADHD.  

If it wasn’t for anxiety, I wouldn’t be afraid to try new things, I wouldn’t be up late at night worrying about things I can’t control. 

I wouldn’t be exhausted all the time and would be able to get so much more done. I wouldn’t have this rush of adrenaline that exhausts me and makes me want to sleep all the time. 

Does anyone ever get that rush of cortisol where your heart beats so fast and you’re exhausted and want to sleep? Social interactions exhaust me. Fuck you anxiety. ",1cot5ek

Anxiety,"Had my first panic attack in months, I need support","Guys, I am here after experiencing a panic attack on the bus. I felt really bad, like I was going to die or faint. My whole body became hot and it was literally burning inside and out. It was like I had pure acid running through my veins. I thought I was going to die for real. I had to step out of the bus, and I went to a Burger King to charge my phone, because I was literally afraid of dying and not talking to my family before. I had to take Rivotril to abort the panic attack, and even after that I had a mini panic attack. I was so scared guys, I need you to tell me everything is going to be fine. That those symptoms are going to pass and I am going to be free of this terrifying disorder.  Can anybody tell me stories of overcoming all of this successfully and once and for all? I need someone to cheer me up. Anyways, I know exactly what happens to trigger those symptoms, I was not aware of the impact of those events in my emotions. I am a health professional and I happen to work with pregnant women, in a hospital. Those women usually have some health issues that we need to be looking at closely. This past week, I happened to lose 3 tiny little babies, they were born dead, and I was so traumatized by those events, I literally cried in front of everyone. I know that’s part of the job, that I should keep a healthy emotional distance. But I don’t know how to do that, I don’t feel like I could…. I am having therapy sessions weekly to understand myself and my reaction to everything that happens around me, but I know it takes time. I think what I need now is someone cheering me up 🥹",1cp1k3y

Anxiety,My anxiety is getting better!,"I was extremely anxious growing up to the point where I couldn’t eat at all (which led to me being super underweight), had unhealthy coping mechanisms like chronically picking my lips, and having severe panic attacks daily.

I’m in college and I want to be part of the scene that goes out to parties, but I don’t know how to know the other girls that go to them or how to hear about them. I’m sitting at my computer on a Friday night when I should be out doing something fun, but without my boyfriend, I don’t seem to know anyone who goes to parties and I don’t know how to know them.

I feel anxious about my age. I know I'm young, but at the same time I feel like 22 is the age where people start seeing you as a ""real adult "", rather than a young adult. I'm currently still in school, so I'm not earning my bachelor's degree at the traditional age of 22. I just feel insecure about my age. I also know some may still consider me a young adult. I know my thoughts don't make sense. I just want to enjoy my youth without freaking out about my age because one day I will be in my 30s and 40s and wish I would have enjoyed my late teens/early twenties more instead of being anxious all the time about growing up.

Anxiety,Severe irritability out of the blue,"To preface, I have struggled with anxiety for years and years of my life. Sometimes it feels like I have never been not-anxious and not-depressed. I've had low, low spells all throughout my twenties and typically come out of them for a small period of time, then they eventually return.

With that said, I have never, ever experienced irritability to this degree. I am almost worried at how bad it is. A shift happened a few months ago and I get so annoyed at everything my girlfriend says - even seeing her name on my phone triggers me. I don't tell her this but keeping it to myself is hurting and I'm so confused. I see a picture of somebody online I don't know and I am just instantly disgusted by them in a way that makes no logical sense. I avoid my roommate at all costs and if he harmlessly burps I get put on edge. If someone confronts me on the street negatively, I'll sass them back without a care. My heart is constantly racing like it's always on edge and just in permanent-disgust with the world. Fight or flight x1000.

As you can imagine, it is awful to live like this. I'm a Pre-school teacher, I'm fairly self-aware and can contain my actions and remain calm + normal in most situations, however, the intensity of these feelings are killing me. It's not who I am, and it's not who I ever was, and it sure doesn't align with who I want to be. Help!

What's happening? Could an underlying issue or illness be causing this? I've been having extreme teeth sensitivity and jaw pain lately, though my dentist says he sees nothing that could be causing it. I'm always exhausted. My hair is coming more brittle and my face looks like it aged 5 years in the past six months. Very stressed from work, but this feeling is adding to the stress so it's like a vicious cycle.",1cp5hrb
Anxiety,Panic attack or psychosis please help ,"I smoked weed for the first time tonight, I didn’t feel anything for like the first 6 puffs then I lot going and the next thing I know I’m having an out of body experience like I can see myself and mainly my arms down above kinda like third person.

Anxiety,Anxiety/Panic has ruined my career and travel opportunities,"Ever since being diagnosed with panic disorder, I've missed out on family vacations because I can't stand the thought of being trapped on a plane ""in case something goes wrong"".

Anxiety,Stuck in this weird social anxiety loop,"A bit of a background check, im 16 years old, ADHD, still in high school dont have many friends. I have been dealing with this weird cycle since i was about 8 years old. The cycles usualy go something like this:

Stage one, im completely socialy isolated, no friends or acquaintences. I struggle to do daily chores, i struggle to take care of myself.

Then stage two, i try to be more social, i gradually start opening up to people and be able to start conversations easily and more confidently. I also become less critical about myself and take better care of myself.

Then stage three, something bad or embarassing happens like unintentionaly hurting someones feelings or saying something confidently that is compleately wrong and then all the anxiety that i thought i was able to grow away from hits me like a brick.

Then that anxiety makes me slowly distance myself from everyone in my life and go back to stage one.

These cycles usualy happen during the span of 1 to 3 years. I think a lot of the anxiety started with my toxic friends in middle school and some of the negative comments my mom used to give to me when i was younger

Idk how to stop being so anxious about making friends and how to stop punishing myself so harshly for honest mistakes. I want to be able to stop this tortuous cycle as fast as possible, do you guys have any advice?

Anxiety,Last night i heard this weird dinging sound coming from my desk. I’m worried,It sounded like an electronic alarm kind of thing even though i had no other phones or whatever there. There was only my laptop. I don’t think it was coming from the laptop though. I had the biggest panic attack i ever had. I tried to sleep at around 11:30 and fell asleep around 1:00.

Anxiety,"Doctors recommend exercise, but how when I feel horrible during physical activity?!","OK so I'm 24m and have really bad anxiety and hypothyroidism. As well as some barely visible mitral valve prolapse and extrasystole. The rest of my vitals are all perfect. My heart is perfect. Everything is 100% in full working order. I am a bit chubby, I could say even obese by BMI.

My doctors (Cardiologist, and a neurologist who I really respect because he's a leading expert in the region) both recommend - exercise! 

But even walking up and down the stairs creates horrible sensations. My blood pressure jumps up to 150/100 from walking down the stairs with my dog and having them back up then walking down the stairs again and up to get something.

I do mostly lay around all day and scroll my phone. I feel safe when laying/sitting because my heart rate and BP are slow. As soon as I get active and my pulse and BP shoot up, I feel EVERY beat and feel out of breath and like I will choke or my heart will stop.

There was a short while when walking out wouldn't give me these feelings and I could walk the city for hours or do hard physical work or even swim. What gives? What's wrong with me? Physically there's nothing ... heart has exceptional EF, no blockages no cholesterol... lungs have even a higher capacity than usual on spirometry, im HS I could breath dive! WTF?!",1copqwc

I’ve been very hyperaware of existing and moving my limbs and my eyes and I get scared to move and talk and do anything because it feels so damn strange . 

And the Derealization just sucks. I know that’ll go away when my anxiety does. It’s just hard to experience.

Anxiety,pain,"24(M) About a year ago I was put on antidepressants and lost insurance, ended up saying screw it and thought it would be better to just deal w it on my own so I wasn't depending on something that would affect me if I didn't have it. its been about a year and a half and I'm recently back on insurance. I thought it was bad then its so severe now. Sometimes I have to be strong for myself and just tell myself I'm being a hypocondriac just to relax myself. I recently made a list of what pains have been bothering me the past couple of months and recent pains. Tbh, the list is long but its also been building up bc I haven't seen my doctor in so long. I actually have an appointment with my a doctor in the same office until I get to see him bc he is booked. Actually went to the ER last night bc of my pulse was 136... they said it was blood pressure ehich i have not been diagnosed w it yet. Blood clots came out of my socket the same hour but basically I keep getting pains in my side and they have ran tests and tell me my kidneys are fine. They've run blood tests and tell me everything looks good but what doesn't the blood tests cover? like colon n things for hernia. Idek anymore, I have a bumb in my chest that hurts idk if its cancerous, been getting pain my belly button dont know and jnder my rib cage. funny thing is too that ill only get chest pain in the same spot n they have done mri. even when i feel like i am not having any anxiety ill feel that pain there and idk if its my nerves from my arm and hand traveling that is messed it or not bc now my left leg hurts bad since last night and my big toe keeps twitching which usually means not enough blood flow, stuff like that can cause paralysis. I have an appointment monday but how the hell am i supposed to give her this list and ask for genetic test for anxiety medication, referral for physical therapy, and chiropractor bc of my horrible posture that most likely is causing these nerves to be messed up. also am wondering, if the er people ran blood tests on me last night, do you think ill be find or should be worried about a hidden problem that blood tests dont show? idek where to start or begin or anything anymore. it has messed my mental health up so bad i feel like I am just living too much in my head and that I am living in overdrive rn and idk what to do. I'm worrying so much about my health but i am having so many pains all the time that are unknown and hard to differentiate them from anxiety or soemthing very serious bc of how long i haven't seen the doctor. sorry ik many won't read this, ig Im looking for some reassurance idk sorry guys",1cp6lx0
Anxiety,Might have cured my anxiety,"I have tried alot of things and from what I know worked for me was kefir and meditation. I started off doing guided meditation when I have an episode and it helped, but what I think really kicked the anxiety ass was taking kefir. Sounds weird but I read alot about gut and brain axis. I'm assuming I had a bad gut. So far I'm a 1month in taking kefir and I have had zero episodes. Which is alot cause I use to get them once maybe twice a week.

Anxiety,Am I paranoid? Is this amount of fear normal?,"I’m 14. Whenever it’s late at night, I can’t look through windows or at mirrors because I’m afraid of something/someone standing behind me or near me. (Also, if anything moves in my reflection, I just leave the room as quickly as possible/after i finish whatever i needed to do in that room.) If I hear any small noise/creak/anything my chest tightens up because I feel like something is moving towards me. I’m afraid of the dark and when I’m turning off the lights to go to sleep, I have to do it in a particular order that I’m never standing too far in the dark. Changes in ambiance scare me (ex an air conditioner turning off or on or a fan changing its volume)When I shower, i have to turn around constantly and can’t close my eyes too much even if i’ve gotten soap in them because i’m afraid there might be something else in there with me. I’m only ever this scared of everything at night.

Hearing descriptions of fictional horror, playing horror games, or watching horror movies makes me more afraid of everything for a day or two more. If I’m ever home alone at ANY TIME, I barely leave my room because there’s not a presence of anyone else to comfort me.

I am not currently medically diagnosed with any mental illness. I have suspected ADHD and may be on the autism spectrum.

Anxiety,I developed a fear of being in a car just because I thought about it too much,"I’m in my 20s. My whole life I have been fine being ridden back on a 6 hour car journey.

My Dad was driving me back to my family and we were talking about how a car moves, inertia and stuff like that and all of a sudden I’m now extremely conscious about the motion of the car like I’ve never been before.

Suddenly a feeling comes into my mind that I’m being forced forwards by the motion of the car against my will and my body is now trying to fight it.

What used to feel like a completely normal ride suddenly feels as though I am now falling towards my death indefinitely.
The 60 mph speed on the motorway now feels like an insane rollercoaster ride as if I carry on being in the car my body is going to be ripped open or flung out of the car.

It felt as though my body was trying to resist the motion of the car and I kept praying for a red light or some hold up to slow the car down.

I was now in fight or flight mode and felt like I wanted to scream “Stop the car! I’m going to die from shock if you carry on driving!”
It felt like an eternal fall forwards that was never going to end.

I tried closing my eyes and imagining that the car was a stationary coin-slot toy car to pretend that it was not actually moving but the shock of being in the car was overriding my best imagination.

If felt like I was going to die from shock if the car didn’t immediately stop.

My hands started drooping with sweat and my head felt like it was going to explode.

It felt like my death was imminent if I didn’t somehow stop the journey or grab the steering wheel. It felt like the greatest hell on Earth I had ever experienced.

I felt as if I was going to have a heart attack or a stroke if the car didn’t stop.

Fortunately there was only 15 minutes left and I managed to somehow hold on.

I’ve been completely fine being driven at 60mph+ speeds in the car on the motorway my whole life, but all of sudden just because I started being conscious about the movement of the car I’m now feeling as if I’m in an imminent death situation.
I don’t know what to do since I have to take a 6 hour car journey back but I fear it being the end of me.

What if I go on that car journey and I’m unable to make myself feel like I used to feel (that being in a car is fine and safe).
I had this experience once when I was 18 and the feelings disappeared when I stopped thinking about them.

The phobia will disappear if I don’t think about it and I won’t feel anything like I’ve described in this post. But supposing I don’t feel fine the next time, am I going to die from the shock?

I’ve gone from enjoying car journeys to wishing I could be knocked out with an anaesthetic for the whole journey.

8 years ago I had phobias like a paralysing fear of infinity or existence that would cause my whole body to shake whereas now I’m talking about infinity and existence all the time.

I guess my attitude is that should I die from the shock of being in a car then I’ll just die because there’s no way I can live a life not being able to travel anywhere or do anything because I might develop a phobia of it.",1cp5kbu

Anxiety,Unique type of anxiety symptoms I haven't seen in other people,"Hey all, making this post to mostly satisfy my curiosity regarding my ""condition"". I have seen many others suffering from anxiety/depression around me in groups I've participated or even in the hospital, but never really met someone who could understand what I had. Even the psychiatrics/MD usually just considered my condition as GAD, which I don't think it is.

Long story short, I've always had anxiety, but it was never a somatic issue until I got a concussion when I was 30yrs old (I'm 37 now). Then, something weird happen. I would get a general feeling of malaise that would last multiple hours a day. I would also get this extremely weird feeling of my mind going ""crazy"" or ""accelerating out of control"" when I tried to solve problems at work (programming problems). It's hard to describe, but it's basically a panic that only stems from the mind/brain and not the rest of the body. Almost like a seizure, sometime a feeling of pre-fainting (I shake my head when that happens, almost an instinct). One time it got so bad I felt that something ""snapped"" in my brain while trying to find a programming error and I was left in a state of flight or fight for many weeks.

That was basically it for my life, I've never been able to work normally again, and even mundane things like watching a movie sometime triggers ""panic mind"" or ""pseudo-seizure"" as I call it. I cannot read books for more than 10-15min at a time, simply looking at the lines and trying to understand them can trigger ""panic mind"". I've never seen anyone like my case before, who had to stop reading or watching movies. Weirdly enough, I can play video games just fine if they don't involve lots of reading or problem solving (""brainless"" games like fps for example). Trying to fall asleep is also an issue: I can have multiple ""panic mind"" (10+) a night.

Anyone else went through something similar? If so, what helped you?",1cp94a9
Anxiety,My first panic attack in months today,"27yo fem. On meds + weekly therapy.
On the bus, I had my first panic attack in months. I work in a hospital, and I deal with high risk pregnancy patients. This week I happened to lose 3 little babies, and deal with their sorrowful mothers sadness. I was totally affected by those events. I literally cried at work. But today I had a rough day at work, It was chaotic, and it was enough to take me out of balance. So it was night already, and I was waiting for the bus. I noticed I was really restless, and moving side to side. I tried listening to songs, I tried grabbing something in my grands and feeling it, I tried deep breathing. Nothing worked. The traffic so chaotic, so gloomy… I started feeling anxious to get home, and the bus just wouldn’t move. I started feeling dizzy and suddenly my body was burning like there was acid running through my veins, my throat became really hot and it was on fire, I felt like I was drinking sulfuric acid. I felt like I was going to faint and die, and I didn’t know anyone. I called my parents to say goodbye while I was conscious… that was my first thought. I calmly called them and my father picked it up. I told him to read what I have just sent  by message, and he rushed with his car to pick me up. I stepped out of the bus, and I had to take clonzepam so I could feel better. I did it reluctantly, but I felt like there was no other way. Then I took it, and waited for my father to pick me up while I was in burger king pretending everything was fine though it wasn’t. I am writing this because I need someone o to cheer me up and say this is expected in a panic attack, that it doesn’t mean I have any other health issue. I have health anxiety for the records.

It feels inevitable that I'm gonna have a huge blow-up panic attack soon, and honestly part of me is looking forward to it, just because it might let some tension out of me.

Then I started getting dizzy when walking around the store, out of nowhere. I had a busy day today at work, so I barely consumed any food, so I thought it was mainly due to that. Then we stepped outside the store and as we were walking to the car the dizziness became overwhelming, my eyesight was foggy and my ears were partially “blocked”. My mom asked me if I was okay because the sensations became overwhelming, then my stomach suddenly dropped in a way that I don’t want to ever experience again. I went in full panic mode, my heart started beating super fast and I had shortness of breath. I had to do some breathing exercises to get of the “derealization” state.

It's crowded with folks I would rather not interact with (apologies if that sounds impolite). It's quite packed and PACKED. It's just a really stupid place.

They lure customers in with effective marketing and promotion, even if the majority of their items are processed garbage.

ADHD,How do you manage with losing your wallet often?,"I feel so...incompetent, I lost my wallet twice within a short time frame, it has not even been a month! I fear that the bank may be suspicious that I'm up to something if I report another lost card. Maybe they'll judge me for losing it so often. Do banks care about these things? 

Thankfully many kind people have helped me return them in the past but I feel so foolish. I check my bags and pockets frequently and I still manage to have them slip out somehow. I used to lose my phone but thankfully that hasn't happened in a while, now it seems to be my wallet. 

It's happened so often that I keep my valuables safe at home whenever possible instead of risking it being lost, at this point, my family is concerned for my inability to keep track of important things. For the record, I've tried using a bright and colorful wallet that is small enough to keep in my smaller pant pockets without it bulging out too much but I lost that too. Then I tried a larger faux leather wallet that is kind of bulky but when I put it in my pockets on the bus I managed to lose that one too. When I put it in my backpack it falls out somehow, like the bag unzips itself or something, and sometimes I even accidentally leave it at a restaurant! 

At this point my wallet does not even have ID because I'm scared that I would not be able to get things replaced if I did not have at least some proof of identification. I just use a photo of my ID instead and that seems to satisfy most people. I think I need to change the way I carry important cards with me, maybe I should tether it to myself or something, any advice you may have to help me and my lost wallet would be greatly appreciated.",1coziug

Can’t ever learn in class ever I have to learn EVERYTHING in school myself which is hell because evryone else seems to learn at least some of the material in class meanwhile i can’t bring myself to focus and when i am focusing i don’t understand. 

I can’t keep jobs if I even get them, I am good at nothing absolutely talentless, a fucking idiot with no school smarts, no hobbies because I can’t focus, no skills, no talents, barely any friends because I can’t keep relationships and people also think i’m weird when they get close to me because I am and I talk too much and I always end up getting emotionally abused because I am sensitive  and can’t stick up for myself. 

My room is always a disaster I can barely remember or bring myself to shower or wash my clothes.

ADHD,ADHD Tax is So Real,"This morning, I was about to go pick up a tent I’d bought on Facebook Marketplace. I walked out the door and realized the street was empty. It was street sweeping today.

For reference, where I live they do Street Sweeping once a month. The memory hadn’t even entered my head. I had also been sitting on the porch eating breakfast for an hour before, and hadn’t noticed that all the cars were gone.

I took a Lyft to the city impound lot, brought my title and all my car-related documents which I’d put into a sheet protector in a folder in a fit of organize-my-life energy a year ago. My partner kindly offered to pay for the Lyft.

I get to the impound, wait 45 minutes in line, and when I get to the window they tell me my tags are expired. They could give me the car but they’d have to tow it to my house. Another $150.

So I take another Lyft to the BMV. Wait another half an hour. While sitting there, a cold chill went through me as I realized I didn’t have my documents with me.

Thankfully, I only needed my license to renew my tags. I called the Impound lot and some absolute hero went out in the rain to check and there they were, on the concrete bench outside the building. Thank goodness I put them in a sheet protector so they didn’t get completely ruined by the pouring rain. This guy (and the kind lady I talked to originally) also said I could skip the line when I came back. Thanks guy.

So here I am, trying to ignore my gnawing hunger after a three hour nightmare, waiting for my friend to pick me up from the BMV to to take me back to the impound lot so I can finally pay them to get my car back.

Street Sweeping Ticket: $55

Expired tags ticket: $55

Lyft 1: $20

ADHD,Is getting diagnosed worth it?,"I'm not diagnosed, but I think I have it. 

I have all the ""usual"" symptoms: hyperfixations, inability to concentrate or complete even basic tasks (even when there's nothing else I'd rather do), etc. Not asking whether or not I have it, there's a high chance I do.

But everytime I think about getting diagnosed, I can't help but believe, for som reason, that I'm probably making it all up and it's not a ""real"" condition. I guess it's because that's my parents' stance - they really don't like the idea that I might be ""crazy"" or have any sort of mental health issues at all. Which is fine, they're loving parents, just not educated on mental health. I think my dad or my mom has ADHD as well, but because they refuse to acknowledge it, they've just sort of learned to live with it, and consider it normal. And if they can learn to live with it, does it even matter if I have it? Their lives turned out fine. They don't seem too depressed or affected by it...

Also I'm afraid of medication for mental health issues because of long term side effects lkke making your hair fall out or something. I don't take medication unless I absolutely have to. I don't have any issues with medical procedures, just medication in particular has this stigma of ""it will make all your hair fall out and leave you tired and unhealthy in the long run"". Maybe that's another thing from my parents.

ADHD,From one college instructor to any current/future students:,"Get accommodations for your ADHD, especially if you’re affected by the medication shortage. 

In the US, universities have to comply with official disability accommodations regardless of overarching policy about exams, grade deadlines, etc. This can mean obtaining extensions on projects and papers, missing homework, or even getting an incomplete for the course. Usually professors are allowed to set a deadline shorter than this if they are voluntarily issuing Incompletes to the entire class, but if it’s an Incomplete given for accommodations or extenuating circumstances, the policy is usually one year. 

You do not need a diagnosis of ADHD per se: it is enough to have supporting documentation from your doctor regarding related comorbidities: anxiety, depression, brain fog, chronic fatigue, among others. I have at in the past listed my hypothyroidism and POTS/dysautomia because they had a huge impact on my ability to sit upright in a chair, not vomit from nausea, stay awake, and focus on my work or exam. 

Don’t make the mistake of thinking, whether or not you are medicated, that you don’t or won’t ever need your accommodations. This is a legal obligation under the ADA in the US. Better to have the accommodations in place and never need them than wind up in a situation (say… a medication shortage) where you’re totally screwed with no adequate fallback. 

And while yes, you can appeal to instructors individually, if your appeal is couched in your disability (and not, for instance, a death in the family), the instructor has no obligation to accommodate you and will often hesitate or refuse because this can be viewed as favoritism or discrimination against the other students. 

You have to file accommodations every semester. Do it and enjoy the peace of mind. :)

ADHD,How do you remember?,"I'm still trying to navigate through life better.

Not sure how I manage to forget things immediately but the things I do remember are extremely specific and probably things other people would overlook in a conversation.. I tend to hyper fixate on super pointless things.

But I try to get myself to remember something so I write it down or type it into my notes app.. and then I forget to look at any of my notes because I forget that I had something to remember to begin with. I just don't understand! I'm always questioning how I can fixate my thoughts onto the important things!! How do you guys do it if you struggle with it pretty badly?

ADHD,One minute too late submitting my term paper...,"Exactly as title says. got this damn paper assigned on the first day of class. you all know how it goes. started really cranking it out two weeks ago and was doing the usual cram today before it was due. well, it was about 11:56 and i thought i could beat the clock before remembering that i had to save it as a pdf, so i was frantically trying to do that but of course my hearts pounding in my fucking ears and my hands are trembling and i don't even get the pdf saved i just go try to submit it and right before i click on the assignment...the clock hits 12:00.
the submission box closed at 11:59, it's not even possible to try turning it in late. i immediately sent an email with the file attached to my professor (also not as a pdf like it was supposed to be) but of course he emphasized many, many times how he would not be accepting this paper late and there would be zero exceptions. why would there be? he assigned this 3 months ago. but here i am, feeling useless and idiotic again, having a panic attack in the middle of my campus at midnight with nobody to blame but myself. good chance i'm failing this class now. fuck adhd.

ADHD,How did you actually get better at punctuality?,"tldr: **If you've had any success in overcoming/dealing with 'chronic lateness', how did you do it? What worked for you?**

Hello! I (26M) have ADHD, and I have been late to just about everything ever, especially getting to work in the morning. I understand why ADHD can contribute to this (time-blindness, etc.) and, objectively, I know what it would take to make it to places on time (my google calendar is thorough, but rarely followed.) And I am totally aware that ADHD, discipline/habits, and a lot else affect this. I am on medication, which helps during the day, but first thing in the morning seems to be the problem window for me.

My question is for those who were, at some point, 'chronically late', but have managed to overcome that, or plan around it. I know everyone is different, and there are so many factors, and I know that this is something that is harder because of ADHD. But I am so tired of being late all the time, and I'm tired of not being reliable. My boss has been getting on me about it, I'm at a job now where I really do need to be there at a set time, and I really want to actually get over this for so many reasons. **If you've had any success in overcoming/dealing with 'chronic' lateness, how did you do it?

Even after my ADHD diagnosis, it took a while to phase out the Bipolar II misdiagnosis. Costly mistake -- for years it gatekept me from the medication I actually needed.

During the day my adderall is great…I can focus on things without needing to check my phone every 5 seconds. I don’t feel paralyzed, glued to TikTok.

After work I’m stuck on my phone, I feel like I physically cannot put it down. I delete TikTok, then I start scrolling on Reddit. I delete Reddit then I go on my web browser and start online shopping. I put my phone down only to pick it up again 5 seconds later. It feels like someone else is controlling my movements. I’m irritable, impatient, and can’t be bothered to do a damn thing unless it’s giving me instant gratification.

Then I get overstimulated if I go out in public. Everything is too loud, too bright, and I can’t focus. If I have to grocery shop after my meds wear off, forget it. I’m irritated and impatient, I can’t make decisions, people are always in my way, I wonder if I look stupid, I’m reading labels and not even comprehending what they’re saying, until I get so fidgety and antsy I leave before I’ve even gotten everything I need.

I had to answer questions like what my dosage is, what times of the day I have to take it, what the medication improves, and what I still continue to struggle with. 

Whatever, I have no problem answering these questions truthfully since I genuinely need this medication. 

But then at the very bottom it said that my direct boss would be informed that I’m prescribed amphetamines, and that I would be monitored for things like lack of focus and issues multitasking, to which my boss would have to report me to employee health so they can “discuss” issues with my medication with me. 

I don’t like others knowing that I take ADHD medication. Some people don’t care but there’s a lot of people that definitely treat you differently when they find out. It shouldn’t be this way, but it is.

ADHD,Heading to my ADHD evaluation and terrified,"Hi folks.

I (F29) am going to my ADHD evaluation next week and I’m feeling all sorts of emotions.

I’ve been suspecting I have ADHD for two years now but never acted on it because I had a hard time believing it. Even to this day, I am unsure this is what I have. I somewhat feel like an imposter. 

Most people around me say I function just fine and it is true, in some way. I have a high paying job, good relationships and on the outside, my shit seems to be together. On the other hand, I haven’t cleaned my house in two weeks, I’m late on filing my taxes and I’ve been ordering food everyday for the last 3 weeks.

I have typical symptoms like losing my stuff, not being able to focus for long period of times, not performing well at work (although I hide it well from my peers). 

I think what throws me off is the lack of motivation. It’s like I can only do one big task every day. I can clean, or cook, or go for a walk, or go to work but rarely more than one of those. Some days, I can’t even do one. Living exhausts me. Is that what ADHD feels like? Am I lazy?

I am equally scared to be told it is and it is not ADHD. If it is, I can’t believe I wasted 30 years of my life feeling like I am the most unmotivated, laziest person on the planet. If it is not, then I don’t know what it is but I am at the end of my rope.",1cp5lmj

ADHD,Orgasm struggles,"tldr: My bf and I can't finish during sex.

Hey, I (f) have recently started dating a guy who also has ADHD. We are both in our early 20s. It's honestly amazing, I feel so understood, and we have a great connection. Also, he is the hottest guy I've ever dated. Enough said, I am on cloud nine, and I want this to last. 

Here's a catch: neither of us can orgasm. We are basically always edging each other, which can be fun at times, but starts to become frustrating, to say the least. It's not our lack of skill, as we really enjoy what we do, and we have similar libidos. We just can't finish.

I've struggled with this before because I, of course, have a hard time focusing during sex, but also, my previous partners weren't really skilled. Even if I masturbate, my orgasms are rather mild, but at least they are there. I don't know much about his experiences, but I'm planning to talk with him about it.

What can I do? To be honest, I don't really care about my orgasm, but I would really like to make him finish and keep him happy. 

If it matters: he's on Methylphenidate, I take Bupropion. We both also had a pretty long break from having sex regularly before starting this relationship.

They ignore my intelligence and empathy and just see me as someone to baby.

A lot of people just think it's glorified cross dressing when that isn't the case at all. And then when people learn I'm autistic they think I got manipulated into it??

autism,“Square in the Eye” Is Abusive and Needs to Be Stopped!,"[**They're working on a device that flashes over adults' eyes with the goal of 'training' autistic children to make eye contact.**](https://www.squareintheeye.org/) A disgusting video was posted on their Instagram, which has since been privated, showing a distressed autistic child being coached by two adults to look at this flashing device worn on one of their faces.

Autistic children by and large aren't physically incapable of looking at another human's eyeballs or avoiding it because it just never occurred to them; autistic people who don't make eye contact largely do so because it is **uncomfortable**, **disruptive** and even **painful**.

They tried to train me to make eye contact, and it was traumatizing. The 'look at my nose/forehead/etc. stuff? That too. This creepy flashing version of slowly boiling a frog does not make this practice acceptable, and what is particularly vile is this org's justification of social stigmatization.

autism,Not liking cheese is a curse I would not wish on anyone.,"Just miserable.

My family decided to go to a local mexican restaurant (we live in Texas so plenty of those) and I just...didn't order anything. Every goddamn thing on the menu has cheese on it. Even the damn kids menu is like 70% things with cheese like a cheeseburger! Holy shit. It's a similar problem when we go basically any restaurant with western food (no wonder I love Chinese and Indian food so much). There's a German restaurant we've been interested in trying but I already checked the menu online and oh my fucking god, half of it has cheese and half of it has shit my autism doesn't like either. Even fast food places have cheese goddamn everywhere on burgers and shit and they ALWAYS forget to take it off even when I ask (a thing that has turned me off from fast food more than the unhealthiness ever could). I always feel like such a pathetic child asking places to take the cheese off goddamn everything. Also my dad (who is definitely autistic too LOL) loves mac and cheese and has me make it for him a lot and GOD it smells so disgusting, who on earth would WILLINGLY eat this 

I've asked myself many times to just get over it but cheese is one of those foods that my autism just *viscerally dislikes* on a level I just don't want to get over. It is quite possibly the least appealing food on the planet and I live in a culture that puts cheese on fucking everything 😭",1cp32cc

If a food (savory only like meats, ramen, rice, etc not sweets obv) isn't layered with mustard, spice, and cheese, then I don't want it. Funnily enough, this doesn't apply to sweet and salty flavors. Salty is okay, but it's really easy to go overboard. Sweet is just no.

I've never been a social person, I only have about three close friends and I only see one of them semi often. I live with my brother and his girlfriend and we all chat, I go out for walks most mornings and say hi to other people on the trail.  On the other hand, my brother is autistic too and he sees his friends as often as I see mine but they don't berate him about it.

I'm 26F, I know what I like and I know I don't like meeting new people and small talk. I find it really hard when people suggest that I'm lonely - my friend came over for a sleepover and she told me she's worried about me being lonely and told me to reach out more. I just don't really like pointless socialisation. I have a love interest (for lack of a better term) that's long distance and we talk daily, which fills my social battery. I don't drink which makes it a bit harder to socialise as everyone seems to want to go to bars to hang out.

But what I'm getting at is, I feel fine being alone and I like it a lot, but these people in my life who are constantly telling me it's not normal is making me feel abnormal. I just want to know how you cope/feel better about what others think? I hate feeling like an outsider, and when people hang out with me and tell me they feel bad for me because I'm alone a lot it feels like they're only hanging out with me because they pity me.

autism,Job update! ,"As most of you guys know I started my first real job three days ago as a pharmacy assistant. I was dreading it, and very nervous. For background info I’m F 19, I’m a nursing student, and no my employer doesn’t know I’m autistic.

After only two shifts I can say that (so far) I love my job! I love organizing pill bottles, counting pills, filling orders, sticking the patient info stickers on the bottles, getting to wear scrubs, giving people their medications and telling them to have a good day, or to feel better if it’s something like baby cold medicine or something not embarassing like that.

I work again today and I’m up 40 minutes early, excited to go to work. I only work 4 hours today and I’m disappointed because yesterday I worked 7. It’s not even about the money. I mean money is great, and I’m sure it will be nice to finally have some lol. But I just feel like I have a purpose again instead of sitting at home rotting waiting for school to start again in September.

I feel purposeful, and like I’m helping people. The job is so great for the way my brain was built, it’s so organized, there’s always something to do- I hated working at clothing stores and walking around aimlessly for hours refolding the same pile of t shirts with nothing to do but help teen girls find a croptop in their size.  

I found the perfect job (hopefully, I don’t want to jinx it) and I’m really happy. I think that I’m going to be able to keep this job throughout nursing school and not get burnt out. 

Also my co workers are super nice and the pharmacists never get mad when I make mistakes, which I get nervous about because I don’t want them to fire me obviously lol. They tell me how I’m doing so great for it being my first week and I’m so happy that I’m contributing. 

Finally a happy ending to an ND work story? Haha

autism,The first boyfriend I opened up to about having autism told me he didn't think I was autistic. ," I was diagnosed January of last year. On our first date, I told him I have autism because I didn't want to be with someone who would treat me differently for it. He told me he had a family member who was autistic as well. He seemed super accepting and everything was great until we started dating. Immediately it was like a switch. He started making comments that were hurtful to me.

 I have issues reading sarcasm, but it was like an alarm was going off in my mind. Even with not being able to tell if someone was serious, I had never had this happen before. He would just tell me it was a joke and that I took it the wrong way. I kept telling myself to give him the benefit of the doubt, that someone would never say something so hurtful seriously. 
 
 While what I'm about to say isn't an example of the jokes he would make, it was definitely something that put strain on our relationship. I can't remember exactly what, but I mentioned a statistic about autistic people that pertained to the conversation. He then put his hands on my shoulders, looked me in the eye and said, ""I don't think you have autism."" 

 I was so confused. I asked him what he meant and he told me that he didn't think I was lying about it, he just thought I had been misdiagnosed. I told him that made absolutely no sense because I agree with my diagnosis and it was a lengthy process to get diagnosed. He still didn't seem to believe it. I asked him then about his autistic family member. It was a cousin of his who by the sounds of it, was level 3. They are also male.

 I explained to him that autism can present differently in those with ADHD, and women. That I'm also only level 1, so of course I wouldn't act like his high-support-needing cousin. I asked if he had looked into autism at all. He admitted he knew barely anything about it. It took me leaving him for him to take the time to learn about autism.

 I only agreed to get back together with him if he looked into it himself, and also looked into being in a relationship with someone who's autistic. I sent him multiple videos off YouTube by content creators with autism or those who were dating autistic people. Afterwards, he agreed a lot of the things I did matched the behavior of someone who was autistic and apologized for being ignorant. We got back together. 

 That didn't last long. During a disagreement, he threw the autism thing up in my face saying that he had listened to a podcast. Apparently the podcast said that it was just a trend to be autistic. He said he wasn't sure because it could just all be in my head. That broke me. He had pretended to be supportive just to get back together with me, then tell me his actual opinion he had been hiding all along.

 This has made me lose so much progress. The relationship ended in November, but I still haven't told my mother that I have autism. I know if she were to have a similar reaction, it would absolutely destroy me. I've slowly started telling her more and more about autism and she's said things like, ""Oh you do that."", or ""you did that as a child"" but I still don't have the courage. Now anytime I tell someone I'm talking to in a romantic way, I can't help but have the thought in the back of my mind. Are they just pretending to be accepting of it? 

 Any advice would help, anyone is welcome to PM me or comment.

autism,Is the way I respond to change bad?,"I think I have recognized a pattern of how I respond to change. But I don't like it.

I seem to have a minimum of one hour where I am uncontrollably upset. Crying, thinking angry or sad or upset thoughts, sometimes hitting or scratching myself, needing to be away from other people, making vocal noises like grunting or squealing. And then even though I might still be struggling with the change after that, I am finally able to be (mostly) in control of myself again and function better. It seems like this is how I process and then eventually accept change. 

But I don't like it. I don't like not being in control of myself. I don't like how embarrassing it is when other people witness it. It makes me feel bad. I feel like I should be able to handle change better than this. 

This happened today and I am still struggling with the change but now I also feel embarrassed and like I'm a bad person. But I know feeling emotions isn't bad. And I know struggling with change is something a lot of autistic people deal with. But I keep thinking my reactions are out of proportion and my inability to control my reactions make me a bad person. 

Thankfully my reaction today didn't cause any trouble. For the most part I was able to hide away from people until I was calm again, and I didn't disrupt anything either which is good. But I still feel bad. I just want to be able to move on and not be so hard on myself but I don't know how.

autism,I feel like a disappointment.,"I don't know how exactly to start this. I'm honestly just writing this so that I can say everything I feel like I can't tell anyone else and hopefully someone will read it and help me feel less alone.

I was diagnosed with ASD, major depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder when I was 16 years old after struggling with what I now recognize as burnout. This period of  burnout lasted for multiple years, though I can't necessarily pinpoint where it started as I have a really spotty memory before the age of 14 due to a head injury and blocking out the majority of my junior highschool years because of bullying I experienced during that time. I wasn't bullied specifically because I was autistic, as I was masking heavily from my early childhood, though I'm sure that definitely contributed to how I was treated by my peers.

Before I was diagnosed, I felt like I was constantly living life on survival mode, doing the bare minimum to get by. Basic necessities like food, water, sleep, and personal hygeine often fell by the wayside just so I felt like I had enough energy to get through the day. Every social interaction was dedicated to trying to find the perfect reaction to others just so I wouldn't be singled out. I struggled to make and keep friends because of social anxiety. Friendships never lasted, and I would  be left picking myself apart trying to figure what was wrong with me that could've caused these relationships to fall off.

After I was diagnosed, I felt like I finally had answers. Things got a lot better because I was able to find community through online spaces like this one. My diagnosis came right before the pandemic hit, and while that time generally wasn't very good, I found that being in lockdown and having to do my senior year of highschool completely virtually actually was beneficial in that it gave me the break I so desperately needed to recover from years and years of burnout. I thrived in lockdown since I had never really cared to leave home that often anyway. 

I was able to graduate highschool despite having had a lot of difficulty for the majority of my time there. I was accepted into an art school and I felt like I was finally gonna be able to move forward after feeling like I was falling behind my peers for so long. The school was three hours away from where my family lives so when I started school I had to get used to being completely on my own. Going into it I was pretty resolute that I probably wouldn't make any friends but I was fine with that because that just meant I would devote more time to my classes. 

I was wrong. For the first time in my life I thrived socially because I never had to mask around this new group of people that I cared about. Some of them were autistic as well and I finally felt accepted. I even got into a long term relationship which I'm very happy to say I'm still in. For the sake of this post I'll call her V. This was also the first time I was allowed to be openly queer without feeling like there would be repercussions. 

Things started out so well but by spring semester of freshman year everything fell apart. I struggled to balance my academic life with my social life (which became kind of shaky due to my roommate situation)  and on top of that, I have dealt with chronic pain all my life and it only got worse when I got to school. The physical pain made it nearly impossible for me to make it to class some days and unfortunately I was ineligible for any accommadations relating to it because this chronic pain issue remains undiagnosed. I fell extremely behind in all my classes. I was put on academic probation and told I would not be allowed to retun for sophomore year. They said I could  take some classes a communtiy college and transfer back to school eventually but I never did due to multiple reasons I'd rather not explain here.  

I've kept in contact with all my friends from school even though I'm living at home. I hear from them all the time about how the school has changed for the worse, and even though I still want to go back to school and get my degree I most likely won't be going back there ever again.

The problem is that I'm afraid to go back to school and fail again because I don't have the means to take care of myself mentally and physically. If i go back without having found some solution to the pain issue and to my struggles as an autistic person, I would most likely struggle the exact same way. It's been almost two years now of me living at home with little progress and not being able to get a job because of the same issues I had at school. I'm ashamed of myself and I feel guilty because of all the energy, time, and money my family put into getting me to school in the first place. Everyday I wake up and spend all day in the house and I always have this feeling that my parents think of me as a disappointment because I didn't live up to the perfect, independant gifted child that they thought I would be. 

I know that I'm disabled in more ways than one and that I can't measure my successes and failures against other people but it really sucks to watch all my friends finishing up their junior year while I sit at home constantly struggling with basically nothing to show for it. And to make matters worse I don't even know how to make a plan forward. I feel like I'm always sinking in the quicksand while everyone sprints ahead of me. I think one of my biggest worries is that V will eventually realize that I'm just some dead weight she's pulling with her and that I'll lose the only person who's ever made me feel good about being me.",1cp7q63

I was also diagnosed last year, but I’m unsure if that correlates. 

I’m also asking because i read online how a lot of autistics have comorbities like POTS, anxiety, and digestive issues (celiacs, IBS, lactose intolerance - which i have!) and constipation.

addiction,I'm getting clean,I'm quitting meth  I'm 5 days clean and the hardest part of this has been the withdrawal I truly understand why people can't quit or they end up ODing after a relapse. Your tolerance drops really fast once you stop for a few days in the past I was doing about a gram In 1 1/2 - 2 days I quit for 3 or 4days and did not even half a gram and experienced a OD to the extent of seizures like the previous weekend where I had 32 drug related seizures. Currently the worst part is the dreams I'm getting from the withdrawal extremely vivid and unpleasant repetitive dreams. I'll be fine all day but at night it's hell I can't tell real from fake I woke up completely convinced someone was climbing through my window. It doesn't help that I already experience hallucinations (hearing and seeing things) I've tried to get clean from a lot of things and I've failed almost every time but now I have a motive to get clean I like someone I have been with them in my past but they always hated my substance use and we have both matured we where together for over a year we separated dew to my addiction and me getting extremely manic but now we have reconnected and I feel like the same 13 y old that fell in love I love their laugh and smile their confused looks when I say something they find concerning all that. I know I am 15 years old now but when I say we both matured things happen in their life and for me I lost my dad and lost everything I once knew for the third time at 14 I was kicked out from my aunt's house recently yes I lost my dad but all my things from my mom's house and all my mom's things were given to the bank because someone left it in a garage before they lost the house and I also lost my mother in 2022 so yeah I'm also in therapy now and I am getting treatment for my mental health and I am starting the process of transitioning I am a 15 y old trans man ,1cp3v9p

I owned a house, drove a nice Cadillac, had an amazing son with the woman I loved and grew with. We were together for 11 years. We met when I was 16 and from that first day on we were together. 5 years later we had a son and that was the best thing that's ever happened to me. Now I'm 27 and living back at home with nothing and half way across the country from everything that matters to me. I know im feeling sorry for myself and everything happening is my fault.

I know life's going to suck for a while because that's just what getting off of opiates is like. But what got you through that? How did you start to feel alive again?

addiction,How to handle it?,"Hey everybody!

I’m 28 years old and now I’m admitting to myself that I’m addicted to cocaine. I’ve been using it for 5 years now. 
I didn’t think of it as an addiction but now the tables have turned and I fucking feel there’s no reason to bullshit anybody, especially myself.
I just don’t know how to be without it when I’m in a social environment.

My addiction might not be the baddest of forms and pretty much cravings only occur when I’m drinking alcohol, so there goes another addiction or gateway or whatever.
I just dont’t like where it has gone. I used to just drink and that’s it but now I can’t drink without a bag.

I’m very sociable and would describe myself as an introvert and I feel my personality boosts my use/craving of cocaine.

I just want to know if there’s similar people with “similar formula” and how to get over it or how did you get it under control?


I’m open to all the questions and I’ve been to therapy, would just love to hear what people with similar problemas have to say.

addiction,How to help my family member,"My sibling is suffering from what we believe is addiction to alcohol/drugs and food. We believe it’s their way of coping with years of depression, anxiety, weight issues, education issues, etc.

They keep promising us change but and we see a few weeks of small improvements and then another scary episode where they need to go to the hospital for heart issues due to abusing substances. 

We are all so scared and worried. My mom especially. I’m worried for her health along with my sibling. I don’t know how much more worry and anxiety she can deal with.

My question is, what can we or say to help? What helped some of you or what was the ‘breaking point’? I don’t know at all what they must be feeling or thinking, so I’m not sure what to say or do. Talking to them proves to be so difficult. They also say are looking into AA and therapy but they promise to sign up and then nothing happens.

addiction,It just can be absolutely bad....,"I don't have a substance abuse problem.  I have never had a drink, smoked or done any drug of any type (technically I have had a benzo prescribed and those were used sparingly).

My friend is in the hospital.  She is addicted to ""boy, girl, tranq, powder""... which are fentanyl, crack, xylazine and cocaine.

She has a DVT clot in her leg and a very serious infection.  she has already signed herself out of the hospital once to get high.  The doctors told me that if she leaves again she will die.  

I woke up this morning and can't ping her phone.  Pretty sure she ""against medical advice"" left to get high last night.  

I'm not going to abandon her.  But now I will watch with her family the agonizingly painful decay and death a MRSA infection causes.  

She was told directly that leaving was fatal.  And she still chose getting high over staying in a hospital.  She couldn't go 72 hours (they were giving her pain medications as well for her infection/dvt).  

I know it's biology. But I just sit here and am stunned.  To have someone commit suicide like this.  ",1coorjc
addiction,Clean for 5 months but…,"To briefly introduce my experience, I began experimenting with drugs relatively late compared to many others—at around 19 or 20 years old. Initially, my drug use was limited to marijuana for the first few years. I tried other substances but never developed a habit. Marijuana was incredible for me; it was the first thing that could quiet my mind. I could eat, play games, or just relax. Additionally, I was managing to keep up with my studies—thanks in part to help from friends—so I didn't see it as a problem.

However, over time, I began to dislike the person I became when I was high: lazy, unhealthy, and socially withdrawn, traits that aren't typically me (except maybe laziness). I attempted to quit multiple times and failed each time. I promised myself I would quit at every new milestone—graduations, birthdays, and so on—but never succeeded. 

Finally, after completing my master's degree and returning home, where using drugs was not an option, I was forced to quit. I have now been sober for five months, although before this I had been smoking multiple joints daily for at least 2.5 years.

The problem is, I still crave it. The cravings have lessened, and I sleep better. I don’t experience the emotional disturbances that I did in the beginning, and I generally feel good. In August, I will be returning to my university city for a festival where many of my friends, who are likely still using, will also attend. I am partly looking forward to it because of the possibility of smoking again.

addiction,My brother is addicted to cocaine please help,"Hey guys, i need advice please if anyone could help me i truly appreciate it. Last night my brother admitted to me that he is an addict and hes been addicted to cocaine for the past 3 years, and says he hasnt gone more than 4 days without it, and usually does it every 4 hours or so. My family knew that hes done it before, but we never knew the severity of issue. I know this is quite naive as coke is quite literally the most addictive drug on planet earth, but i don’t think any of us knew much. I did some research on it, found it weird he was able to do it on and off, but i believed him. Now with what hes told me, everything is starting to make sense and i realized how obvious his symptoms were. Constantly sniffling, every morning coughing shit up like he had pneumonia, using the washroom a lot, and having weird high and low energies. He also does not take care of himself, he has vapes drinks beer(he says it helps him sleep with the coke), alcohol, cigarettes, and even a bad relationship with food, i literally never see him drink water just glasses upon glasses of coca cola. My dad has had to lock up the garage fridge with beers with a literal padlock, and has had to change the code to his wine cellar downstairs multiple times because he used to steal alcohol for him and his friends. Hes now almost 24, with his own buisness, but makes virtually no money because he spends it on the coke and fast food. Hes been stealing from my parents, lying to them, getting parking tickets, etc. This,all started with legal issues he got involved with illegal weed selling and such (idk im stupid im quite young and dont know a lot about this) so he thought his life was over practically and turned to drugs. 
I tried to tell him that we can get him professional help but he says it wont work and that he will have to fight it himself. I am going to keep urging, because from what ive read i don’t think this is a battle anyone could fight themselves. He tells me that he needs to go to bali or somewhere remote where he cant get ahold of it. He says he hates this country( were in north america if you cant tell by now) and wants to get rich so he can move away and live with our family somewhere with good weather and more farm like. I told him that leaving wont fix your issue, itll seem like it but you obviously have other issues that need to be dealt with besides the coke. He also doesnt 
Want my parents knowing, which ive kept the secret within a day and it hurts so much but i want to stay true to my word. Although my parents and him have gone through a lot of shit, they still love him deep down and will do anything for him. A few months ago my brother was working 2 hours away from home and had to sleep in his truck because he couldn’t afford a motel and woke my parents up at 2am, he sounded so terrible and scared, he had said that he had a sleep paralysis nightmare where a man was trying to get into his truck and he couldn’t do anything, then he freaked out because he didn’t have the right supplies for his job because they gave him the wrong stuff and he’d have to drive 2 hours away and the work needed to be done by 8 am. With barely any sleep, my dad got up (partly in anger) put on some clothes got in his work truck and drove to my brother all at 2am to help him. While he waited for my dad me and my mom stayed on the phone to support him, he told us he wasn’t on drugs when we asked and he ensured us (not sure if it was a lie or not), and he just kept talking about how scared he was and how he’s a bad son and he said he had some suicidal thoughts, me and my mom comforted him and let him know how proud we are of him. 
Since then it hasnt really gotten better, and im just more concerned. Me and him have never really been that close, onlt when we were kids, and when the legal issues happened i hated him for it and i hated him for being so selfish i was always mean to him and now i wish i never did that and just helped him, i was young but it hurts me. Now i know i must do all i can to help him. Hes my brother and he means the world to me, and i cant lose him to this addiction. Ive seen stuff about a medical detox, but is it possible for me to help him cut his dealers off, do i take his wallet and only give him money when he needs it, do i take the keys at night so he cant go and get it? ( he leaves at weird times and comes back with nothing sometimes so i feel thats when he’s getting his fix) i just dont know what to do i dont know if hed even do rehab. also were going on a 2 week trip to europe in the summer, but because of his relationship with my parents and his lack of financial stability, hes not coming with us and it hurt before but now it hurts even more knowing hes gonna be self harming with drugs, no sleep, and working while im “enjoying” my trip. I almost dont want to go anymore. Would it be helpful if he came with us? Im a uni student but ive been working a lot recently and i can and want to buy him a ticket to come with us but im scared withdrawal will be bad. If he somehow quits now would it be a good idea for him to come with us still? Idk  if any of this made any sense or was stupid i just want advice or just any words that can help me because it hasnt even been  48 hours and this is ruining me its all ive been able to think of and im finally waking up and realizing how much hes been struggling all these years. I also want to note that i now know that this is a disease and it isnt willful so i am not mad at him anymore and if i were to tell my parents id tell them that because as of right now they think he’s a selfish person and want him out of the house.

I am a pill popper. I will just say that. Polypharmacy and otc meds to try to make my life feel a bit better. A little floaty and nice. Or sometimes it doesnt work at all.  I dont fully know why I do this now. It started during a time of high anxiety and now its just what I do. Its fucking up my body and brain I have a ton of responsibilities in life. No one would guess I have this issue I cover it well. Some family members I disclosed to. I see a therapist about it and no change. 

Can anyone recommend any books or podcasts that will help motivate me and make me care more about stopping this? There is the part of me that knows i need to change but a bigger part of me who just says 'fuck it let the pills eat me'. I cant do this to my family. I need to read or get more involved in something that will help the fuck it part of me to care more so I can get myself help. I hope thst made sense.

addiction,How to help an addicted friend ,"One of my best friends who I know for almost 10 years is addicted to speed, and tries to quit for as long as I can remember. We talk about this allot, he is super open to me, and how his addiction works in his head. He is not trying to hide it from me and I try to support him in his attempts to quit his addiction.    
  
It started for him when he was 16, popping loads of pills on festivals, and not knowing his limit. When he goes, he goes all out. He wants to experience more and more till his body gives in.   
  
When I met him (26), he had a good job and a nice girlfriend, He finished school, has a good education (master). A functional addict so to speak. Now he had a mediocre job, just to pay the rent. So not a junky on the street, but an occasionally heavy user. 

In a weekend he can use 2-3 grams easy. To a point his heart almost collapses. Sometimes he use continues for 4 days in a row. Uses benzo to sleep, and continues the next day. After his comeback he hates himself for it. Then 3-4 weeks later, he uses again. Sometimes there is 2 months in between, sometimes 4 months. This cycle goes on for years now. 

One time he managed to stay clean for 8 months. He says he feels down, depressed, experiences brain-fog (not able to think clear). This starts after a few weeks of quitting and continues to do so. Has no joy in life, nothing has meaning. After 8 months of this horrible feeling, he could not stay strong and starts using again, just to feel normal again.    
  
He quits for months and then he gives in again, because of his post-acute as he calls it. This fear of feeling depressed is also what keeps him addicted. He knows how he feels without it and is afraid of that feeling. The speed then gives him that fix, the brainfog is gone, his depressed feelings are gone. Just for a few weeks, and then uses again.  

During the years he lost his dreamjob, his girfriend because of this addiction, no money. He has been rock  bottom but still this addiction is so hard for him to quit. He knows this. He does everything in his power to stop. Deletes the numbers of the dealers, blocks his bankcard, living with his parents. But his addict mind still finds a way to get the stuff.   
  
In the years I've know him, he is been multiple times to a rehab. I'm not sure how they help him. He was multiple times in a rehab house for months. But because he can stop for months and then uses heavy again later, this is not helping him. The depressed feelings are still there, and he wants to fix it again. He knows he is addicted, he admits he is addicted, he calls out for help, but still falls back in his habit. Now, years later, his rehab consisted of a group talk, and one on one talks with a psych. It also did not help. 

He is now at a point of just giving in to the addiction, and just giving up fighting. Is there any hope for him quitting? How do you help someone that knows their problem and has been in rehab multiple times? Are there other ways for him to seek help.

addiction,A struggle i was not expecting. Is it too late for me? Can i reverse the effects,"

I am 21 years old, i started vaping around the age of 16-17 due to influence. I was young and experimental like any other teenager. But being positioned around the wrong crowds it lead me to start smoking and vaping. At first it was all for fun and a bit of a way to fit in with everyone else. At this time i would only do it so often and being one of those kids who used to think ‘nah ill never touch a cigarette in my life’ i thought it was something i could stop whenever i wanted. But no instead i was completely caught off guard and was not ready for what this journey had in stock. Alot of trial and error. At the age of 18 i met true stress, a stress that i was not familiar with, vaping no longer did it for me so i was brought down the path of smoking cigs and weed. At the time this did help me but now that i think of it, not in a way that was beneficial. Looking back on it, it was a way to escape reality which intern altered my perceptions and the way i thought day to day. This was only causing me more stress. After this era of my life i found myself having a cig at work every break i got and when i finished i would sesh up till i saw Donald McRonald standing right in front of me. I would wake up most mornings feeling like i only slept an hour and was not at my 100% best. Ik what i needed to cut out of my life but somehow my love for this was too strong. Boom now I’m 21 i cant wait to wake in the morning next to my baby grape gummy flavoured dildo looking pen. Whenever I’m stressed it’ll take me half a second before i start sucking on this thing that isn’t doing any good in my life. I find it tempting to smoke a cig every second i get. Whenever i smell ganja i don’t hesitate to have puff or two. Basically no self control and is what I’m missing in my life. Now I’ve made one of my worst fears become a reality, being an addict. I Never thought in a million years it would be this hard to quit. Here i am telling myself one day I’ll quit, one day I’ll be happy again, one day my face will start looking young again. One day will never come if you don’t start today. This journey is a repetitive cycle and is judged on how good or bad the circumstances you wish to keep repeating. Im fed up with this let’s all hope we get through this together. Remember guys day one not one day. You cant make excuses for yourself any longer, these things are only here to fill that missing piece thats missing but it ain’t fitting so try a fitting a better, more appropriate piece to fit your puzzle. the amount of love you show for all these material things can never bring you satisfaction like it would if all your efforts were focused on bettering yourself. Stay blessed guys and quit sucking on that smoke producing dildo.

For 5 years, I couldn;t continue my journey. So I deleted brawl stars. And I did everything to remove brawl stars from my life. I just dont want to know whether they are giving us free stuff or not. ON youtube, every brawl stars content I saw, I did ""Don't recommend this channel"" Remove brawl stars from my search histroy. and basically did anything that made me think that bralw stars dont exist.

addiction,"I'm abusing my ADHD medication (methylphenidate) and I'm noticing that an addiction is forming, I need help.","Hey everyone,

 I stumbled across this sub while looking to see if anyone had shared their experience on a similar situation as I'm in on Reddit. Let's just say that my will to not fall in another addiction was stronger than the hatred I felt after coming across the millionth ""I hate people who abuse ADHD meds!!!!111"" post on subs related to ADHD, but that's irrelevant.

 I have dealt with an opioid addiction in the past that actually killed me twice, with the help of my amazing girlfriend whom I will be thankful to for the rest of my life, I got off of them. I had relapsed recently so it's now been 4 months since I woke up from a coma after having a seizure and splitting my head in half, even though the Addictology center (I live in France so it's not really the same thing as what's known as a Rehab center in the US) I was referred to after the incident insisted that it was ""unethical for them to get me started on a buprenorphine treatment because I wasn't using opioids"" I managed to fight through the cravings.

 Just as a background, I was diagnosed with ADHD and Autism when I was 8 but my mom outright refused to give me medication. I don't want this post to turn into a ""10 reasons why I hate my parents"" copypasta so I'll just summarize their reasoning for not letting me get treated by mentioning that they're very... Conservative. I'd go so far as to describe them as willfully bigoted. I managed to get re-diagnosed by an ADHD specialist after turning 18 and started treatment again.

 I'm now 22 and I recently started abusing my ADHD medication, going as far as to go through 56 extended release pills each dosed 36 milligrams in a period of ~30 hours. I don't crush nor smoke them at the very least. 

 I tried to take my prescribed dose of 72 milligrams for a day after realizing that I was involuntarily trying to replace one addiction with another and noticed that the worst withdrawal symptoms I had were hypersomnia (sleeping 24/7) and anhedonia, that tells me that the best time to ""quit"" is now.

 Sadly, it's almost impossible to find a psychiatrist appointment lately, during the time I was pretty much living inside a room high off of my mind 24/7 (3 years ago) every single person in Alsace (the region I live in) decided to take care of their mental health and left no psychiatrist appointments :D

 The biggest issue is that I already depend on my ADHD medication to function and doctors are very closed-minded about substance abuse in the region I live in, if I were to outright tell a doctor about wanting to stop abusing methylphenidate (I still think that a doctor is the best way to start recovering from substance abuse) they'll make sure that my dossier médical/patient file automatically deploys the damn army to the pharmacy I'm in while screaming ""THIS MAN IS A COMPLETELY DERANGED MANIAC WHO STARTED DOING PCP IN THE WOMB! DO NOT LET HIM ACCESS A SINGLE MEDICATION UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!!!! through the speakers :P >! we access health care through a card system called Carte Vitale, even though it's basically a ""get %70-%100 off of your medical payment in mere seconds"" card, it also comes with databases allowing doctors and pharmacists to access pretty much every medical detail about a patient including the medications they've been prescribed during the last 2 years <! 

 The exaggeration is for the comedic effect of course, I'll be able to see a psychiatrist soon and I was thinking of maybe adding atomoxetine/straterra to the mix while using 72mgs like I'm supposed to so that the withdrawal to therapeutic doses period isn't as hard as quitting it cold-turkey. If anyone used atomoxetine/straterra I'd be happy to learn about your experience!  

 Thank you for your time :)",1coqfx4

addiction,Addiction to escorts and paid content,"32 M. Throwaway account as a friend knows about my main Reddit and I don't want to risk it. Anyway, I didn't have this problem until a few years ago when I got into my late 20s and gained some weight, and also around that time I'd moved back to my tiny, rural hometown from a major city so I could go back to school. You have no idea how few options there are around here. Also, I'm an introvert with fringe interests, so it's difficult for me to date. I have now lost the weight I had gained, for the most part, but I look older now and just don't have the same confidence I once did. There was a time when I was having sex with a new person every week, and wasn't paying for it. Say what you want about promiscuity, but at the time I was far more emotionally healthy and happy. I also think that like a lot of young people, a chunk of my identity was once wrapped up in my appearance, but now all of that confidence is gone. I'm also an alcoholic - have been sober for a year - so my instinct is always to dive into depravity and excessive behavior to cope with life.

I just don't know what to do. I'm broke due to paying an average of hundreds of dollars every few weeks on porn and escorts, as I will travel two hours to the nearest big city to meet with them. Fortunately I'll be fine as I live in a small town with lots of support. But I can't live like this. I hate myself; I hate constantly dealing with sex workers, as I've already been blackmailed twice in the last two years, and I don't care if this isn't politically correct to say but they are usually terrible people. Why can't there be a pill that takes away your sex drive? Why? I know with 100% certainty my life would be 100x better if I wasn't so horny all the time. I haaaaate that my biological urges are forced on me with not a single way to stop them when they do not benefit me in the slightest. I don't want children, so why do I need it? I've even considered some form of chemical castration.

Sorry for the book but this is just too difficult. I just emailed a supposedly local chapter of SA to find out about meeting location and times, but this will be a tough step for me to take because it's so embarrassing to talk about, especially in person. I don't understand why it all has to be so fucking difficult. I just want peace.",1cofk2k

addiction,Kratom-addiction generated health issues,"Hello people

Please forgive my not native english,
I would like to talk about/read about experiences and knowledge in the topic of the health issues, problems what a person could get of abusing kratom.
I am abusing it- using far too much from like one year-around.
And i have a lots of shit with my body from a few months- i just began to understand it. 
I didnt see a doctor from like 15 years- but now im visiting them daily and trying to figure out whats going on…
Sometimes i have the feeling like im litterally dying… (but i have to attach, to get a whole picture of my situation, that emotionally too these times are the hardest of my life)
My limbs are numbing, to the point that i wake up a night like 20 times for this fucked up feeling- i cannot even move them for a little time, they are senseless too), my heartrate is crazy and it beats always differently, i lost a lots of weight and dont have any hunger like ever, dont have any energy to get out of bed, to live, 
And i could just continue the list of my problems- but i guess it would be boring to read —- i just feel generally very fucking shitty.
And i did so much things in my life in a way not taking any care of myself, of my body, future…
But i did stop drinking any alcohol from 2and a half months (before this was drinking until blacking out almost daily for several years)
I also began 1-2 years ago to give a fuck really and i was smoking crack and heroin for a few months daily too— but this were also finished 1-2 years ago, i took every possible drugs what i could get or find on the floor etc.,
But i stopped with this lifestyle, and i began to feel so fucking better, i had a big progress in my life.
The only things im addicted still for, are marijuana, and kratom.
Marijuana is closed out of the possible health-issue factor in my opinion, because i smoke it from like 10 years daily, and i know it, and i know about it, its not poisonous to me… phisically for sure.
But the kratom is the thing what i am on 0-24, i take 50-70 grams a day in general i would say.
I tried to taper down multiple times with not a lot success.  I convince myself always that its good to me/i really need/really love it, and im okay with it, not a big thing. But I feel sometimes like im never even enough clean ever of kratom to have the power, the consciousness to be honest to myself about it, and to just simply… dont forget what i was promising to myself just half a day ago….. 
But also at the same time i dont even really get high of it anymore. Im just very fucking scared always of the withdrawals, so im taking it 0-24. Oufgh those sweet withdrawals… pure hell. 
And even with tapering down (generally my techique was to lowering it 2 grams less per each day, and i did arrive to 19 grams per day, but i felt shit. Not full blown WD’s but… i feel enough shit in my life apart of kratom wd’s, so i dunno…. Dont know how to do.

Thats it, i dont make it longer
I am interested about your knowledge, could be kratom behind a lots of health issues?
I dont talk about it to doctors, unfortunately i feel its better this way, coz i had law-problems about my drug-usage at the past.
And also the doctors at my country wouldnt know shit about kratom. The only thing what they could know is that if you write in my native language to the google that ‘kratom’, every single post at the first page is like “kratom: the legal heroin”.

So… thanks a lot for taking your time to share info about the subject, if you do!
It could be helpful to more people.

addiction,I fucked up and ruined my sobriety ,"I have been sober from cocaine for a year

My guy texted asking if I want adderal. I said yes, he has sold legit stuff before

I googled the pills and say everyone say it was meth. I took it anyways, then I kept taking them.

That was a week ago.

I haven’t eaten a full meal this entire time. I have hardly slept and it’s 3:30 am right now. I’m freaking out.

This is a shout for help. I want to sleep.


EDIT: I just woke up 8am after getting 2 or 3 hours of sleep and feel like I’m back in reality, but I’m still buzzing and feel sick

Thank you everyone for your comments. I have flushed the remaining pills. It is absolutely meth. I bought 30 for 10ea which no one sells adderal for.

So terrible - I’m never touching it again - I feel like I was in psychosis. I was messaging people during the day yesterday saying how about how much love and happiness I had etc. which is WEIRD but I felt it and I never questioned “oh I’m really high on something and loaded touch with reality”

It wasn’t until the mood flipped and I started reflecting on how I I’ve been acting and how I was lying to friends already to stay locked inside - literally a total repeat of my prior periods of time of daily drugs

God I don’t miss it at all. I hate it so much. Especially how I just blocked it out of my mind as I was doing it



Another edit: it’s now 11am and I can’t stop crying. I’m just so sad. People are bothering me at work for stuff they need and I can’t function. I’m just crying and I don’t have anyone to talk to. I just can’t bare to break the news to anyone. I feel so awful.",1cns099

addiction,My brother's addiction,"I'm mostly writing this to get it off my chest.  I am so f\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* upset right now.  

My older brother has been an alcoholic since he joined the Navy 26 years ago.  Since then he has gone through countless relationships and countless jobs.  He's been through recovery programs again and again.  Every time he hits rock bottom, he gets a chisel and digs some more.  My parents have had tremendous emotional and financial tolls trying to help him.  I love him like any brother should, but I don't know how to keep going.

  Today has taken the cake, and I'm ready to give up on him.  A bit of back story, he married his ex-wife 5 years ago, after being together for 5 years.  I never thought their personalities really matched, but they seemed to get along ok, so I just went with it.  2 months ago, he asked for a divorce.  The reasoning was that she would not move closer to our family, and that should did not want to have kids.  These are things he knew when he married her.   He claims that whenever he sees my sons, his nephews, he gets really depressed, because of how badly he wants kids of his own.   He also had been seeing a woman on the side for the 6 months.  She wants to have kids and will move closer to our family to be with him.  I was pissed, but he gave me his reasoning and I calmed down.  He once again, finagled a large sum of money from my Dad in order to pay off his ex-wife and get the divorce finalized quickly.  

We just found out today, that he's been lying to his new girl(I'm not sure about what) and has been on a non-stop drinking fest for a week.  She's apparently leaving him.  None of us can get ahold of him, and he will not answer any phone calls.  He's apparently bunked up in some hotel room.  I'm just waiting for the phone call that he's dead.  This will kill my parents...

I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 11 years. We are 25 and 26 years old.

My boyfriend was using cocaine 2 years ago and ended up really ruining things in our lives. He got himself to jail, we lost our home, disappeared for the whole summer, used me financially for his own benefit by lying and stealing, had secret affairs while being with me like none of these affairs were happening (even lied crying to these people that I’m a crazy ex who stabbed him?!) etc…
I was done with him but then 8 months ago after he got out of jail he changed his lifestyle and said he will show me that things will get better. He got sober, disconnected with old friends, got a job and a new apartment. Everything was going pretty good and we were happy.

BUT, now I found out he has been using again for the past two weeks couple times. He says he’s sorry and the history won’t repeat itself.
It doesn’t seem like that. He doesn’t answer the phone, has been somewhere else for the night etc.

How can I make him stop or is this a “lost case”? I’m stressed and scared . I was maybe stupid to trust him.
Is this normal behavior for an addict? Or am I dealing with someone crazy with a  personality disorder and even if the addiction is gone, he is not safe?

I truly thought that was completely impossible.  I’m taking it one day at a time, knowing that I am taking my life back. Cigarettes were making me extremely miserable. This is just a different type of temporary misery that will lead to improved health and money in my pocket. Last week, I calculated what I was spending on smoking and it shocked me. I didn’t want to buy a pack after that so I spilled out the cigarettes that were in my ashtray to find one that I could light up for a few puffs. When I looked at that paper plate with a bunch of nasty butts I felt so stupid. To think I’m spending so much money on that nasty garbage. That was the first major straw.

I'm not willing to give up all the other things I enjoy along with cigarettes. Right now I feel extremely motivated to enjoy some nights out without worrying about smoking while drinking. I feel like making through this weekend will be monumental for me.",1cotgkw

stopsmoking,Prison Architect helped me quit smoking,"I smoked from the age of 14 to 28 and it was one night and a specific moment that gave me the epiphany and final will to quit. I had thought about quitting before and tried to slow down or cut down but never really committed stopping cold.

The one thing I attribute to giving me the real motivation to quit smoking was the game Prison Architect.

In case you're not aware prison Architect is a game where you design a prison, you have prisoners, you have rooms and they need to go to reform classes etc. The game went through an extensive early access or alpha stage where they kept adding features and needs to prisoners.

One such update was one that added the religion and reading needs. All of a sudden my prisoners needed to have access to a church and a library to read books as you can imagine this completely screwed up the original prison designs.

It was this moment and this mechanism of adding needs that made me suddenly realize that smoking was exactly that, an added need. Something that was artificial and unnecessary and was a pain in the arse. I could do more, spend more, go to more places and be accepted by more people without it. 

I'm just like the prisoners in the game, I didn't need to have an extra need, I could just make my life easier and have less things to worry about.

So for me it was Prison Architect and the realization that it's an artificial or added need really helped me quit.

When I decided that evening, i still had tabacco and papers, I didn't throw them away. I just decided to stop. Quite surreal when I look back on it.

I used chewing gum for a day or two and then realized it was making my mouth itch and just kind of putting off the real withdrawal I needed to face. So I stopped completely and was using elastic band on my wrist to torture myself when i wanted to smoke. First 3 days were hard. Day 5 was really bad but after that, it just got easier.

stopsmoking,"Prolonged Withdrawal, Feels like it Will Never End (8 weeks in)","26 year old male. I used vapes for 3 years and then Zyns for 1 year. I began having chest pains one day and decided to quit cold turkey. It’s been 8 weeks.

All symptoms such as headache, brain fog, and cravings are gone. The only things left are what feels like to be an internal burning pain inside my chest that radiates out into my armpits. I have gone to the ER to be checked if I’m having a heart attack, but was told I was simply having a panic attack.

This continues to persist constantly. Random shooting & burning pains that appear in my chest & back.

I’ve also become hyper paranoid about the possibility of me having cancer. I’m conjuring up reasons why I have all forms of signs that I have cancer in every location of my body. I’m constantly going back and forth with doctors (my Primary Care Physician, GI doctor, etc) and they’re telling me I’m fine.

So I’m just looking for some feedback from some other people who have seemed to go through this:

1. Has anybody else has extended withdrawals like this that seem to never end?
2. Am I just sitting here inducing panic attacks in myself by worrying?
3. For those who had extended withdrawals, how long does this last?

stopsmoking,700 Days Quit Today!,"I remember the early days when I first gave up cigarettes, I found this sub and would occasionally post progress. I thought about it today and realized I have not posted here in forever. I was a 21 year smoker friends, also a 15 year daily drinker. I quit smoking the day before I gave up drink and honestly...it has been LIFE CHANGING! 

I feel better, I smell better, I eat better, I sleep better, and I'm in the best shape of my life. I joined a gym and I'm in there consistently 5-6 days a week. When I first started this journey, I was 2 months into a separation from a 14 year toxic relationship... I was lost & in terrible shape mentally. I am now divorced and still sober from smoking and alcohol living the best years I have in over a decade. 

I just want to say... If you want to quit go for it, it is totally achievable and after a certain point you won't even think of smoking anymore. It used to be the first thing I thought of when my nerves were torn up, these days its a fleeting thought of a time that seems really far away. To date I have saved over $5,000 in no longer smoking.

I quit smoking almost exactly 6 years ago, I've had moments of weakness a couple of times in the last year where I bought one vape, finished it, and didn't repurchase, and when I smoke weed with some friends they sometimes mix grabba into the weed.

For some reason after these last few smoke sessions with friends I have had intense tobacco cravings. I finally gave in and bought my first pack in years. I smoked a cigarette and it tasted great, it felt great, I heavily enjoyed it. But the aftermath of feeling like I threw those 6 years of being in control away hasn't been great, I almost felt like crying because I can't believe how much I enjoyed it.

I don't want to become addicted again but I've been fighting pretty strong cravings within my last year for some reason. I do other things to focus on my health like regular exercise, eat healthy, try to have healthy hobbies but for some reason even with all of that the tobacco kept calling my name.

Has anyone else experienced similar feelings and struggle with fully quitting?

Last night my partner and I went for dinner, I had one glass of wine, and we had a stupid disagreement about politics. Nothing big and not at all a ""fight"" but it left both of us with a bad taste in our mouth and when I dropped him off, I immediately drove to the Quicky Mart and bought a whole pack. I had about six drags and just put it out. It tasted gross and I was so disappointed in myself, but it felt FAMILIAR. I drove home and gave the rest of the pack to my partner to hide or dispose of for me. I brushed my teeth, drank some water, and went to bed feeling sad and depressed, but I am not going to smoke today.  


I'm not resetting my QuitNow date or anything but I'm feeling down today realizing how it will likely always have it's claws in me. I'm kind of mourning the fact that I'll never have another one of those up all night talking over a full ashtray nights. I loved those nights.

I also quit alcohol for this duration….I was with family so I think it was easy. When I was alone again on the 28th I got some beer and while I was 3 cans deep I had one cigarette…just one. 

Now I did not feel an urge to smoke more nor did I feel shit. The drunk cig after almost a month was exhilarating. I didn’t smoke for almost 5 days since. HOWEVER, I started smoking again EVEN WITHOUT THE URGE EVER SURFACING. I just don’t understand my brain. I didn’t have any urges until I smoked them in my system and now I do. I quit again and the urges are back. 

I just came to the realisation that I am an addict at heart and if I start smoking I also indulge in alcohol, sugar and porn indiscriminately. Will it ever improve? Will the self destructive tendencies ever go away? Will the numb urge to smoke and binge and crash my  dopamine receptors ever fuck off?

stopsmoking,46 days cigarette-free,"Hi guys! I'm soon to be 50 days nicotine free and i thought maybe my experience may be helpful for people who are doubting about quitting and ideas about never feeling complete again without nic.

So, I've been trying to quit for like half a year now, and before this, my longest streak was a week max. and even then I was fucking desesperate for a damn ciggie every awake moment of my day.

I was feeling so SO frustrated and angry with myself for not being able to commit to such an easy task as literally NOT doing an action or refraining to do so.
But I soon realized no good change come from self-hatred. So, first step I did was changing my perspective about nicotine (internalizing and rlly make myself come into sense and really see and feel that nic doesn't do any good and it's expensive and nasty overall) and being more self-compassive.

Next, try your first 3 days to be away from nic, or, if you live with smokers (like I do) watch them. Seriously. Watch them closely, every drag they take. Until they finish the cig. 
Maybe this is too personal, but all my family members are smokers, so i'm surrounded by smokers all the time. And I can see from first-hand how it can steal all the liveness and spark to people, how it can deteriorate the life quality of the user.
So, watch them. How they scrunch and half-close their eyes when smoke gets too close to their face, how they freak out when they forget their cigs or lighter at home, etc. That'll make you reafirm your recent-instaured thoughts of nicotine being nasty.

And, last, focus on dealing with all the shit nic used to mask. Don't get me wrong, I feel kind of depressed sometimes, because I cant suppress all my emotions by smoking, but I'd be lying if I said this isn't the most nourishing and interesting self-discovery journey i've had experience.

Im sorry for my shitty grammar (not native speaker) and such a long ass post, I'm kinda tipsy and wanted to get this out of my chest in hope it could maybe help someone.

OpiatesRecovery,NEW DANGEROUS SYNTHETIC WORSE THAN FENTANYL!!⚠️,"THIS IS A BIT OF A READ BUT COULDD SAVE LIVES !
So the past year here in the UK nitazenes have been making their way into batches of Heroin, we’ve had clean heroin for YEARS, it’s heartbreaking to see that slowly but surely we’re being poisoned. maybe it’s something to do with the poppy ban in Afghanistan and the Talibros being mad about dope production none of it makes sense, I can’t be the only one who would rather have fent than fucking Zenes in our door which is WAY worse by the way, first it started out just in fake oxy which was obvious because we don’t have m30s in UK and the pills that were pressed Sandoz 40s or whatever were loose which we also don’t have loose Oxy over here so it was easy to tell. 

Now even the most trusted vendors have beeen caught with Zenes in their batches and the worst part is it’s getting to the point where some Zenes aren’t even detectable same thing that happened with k2 back in 2015-16, they need to hurry the fuck up and decriminalise drugs before our opi death rates sky rocket higher than America because Zenes are bad news and I’m not even sure if narcan works and if it does it’s gonna need like 5x usual dose, don’t be confused either by Xylazine the Anesthetic and Nitazene the synthetic Opioid. stay safe ppl, if you use the main 🧅 vendors chances are they got Zenes in, so I can’t even imagine how bad street gear is. Stay safe even tests can’t pick up half the chemicals these days and ESPECIALLY DO NOT BUY LOOSE OXY NO MATTER WHERE IN THE WORLD YOU ARE !!!

They need to make narcan readily available to buy online in uk without a script 

Please be careful if you’re buying opiates here in UK you may have been safe before but we no longer have clean heroin it’s getting more common everyday to find batches of H and pressed oxys filled with Zenes EVEN PRESSED DIAZEPAM/VALIUM HAVE BEEN FOUND WITH THIS AWFUL STUFF IN!! 

Please buy some Nitazene tests but even then you’re not 100% safe because as I’ve said not all Zenes can be picked up by tests as it’s a research chem. 

THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU CRIMINALISE ADDICTS, IT MAKES THINGS WAY WORSE. First in UK we had synthetic weed problem with spice now it’s synthetic Heroin and it’s way worse than even fentanyl and that’s saying something, please upvote this or share it or atleast spread the information to those that use these drugs because this is only the beginning , in the next few years I think 90% of H is gonna be laced with this stuff, We need to decriminalise and have better Harm reduction and fix the stigma on addicts and go the route of Canada and give addicts Hydromorphone scripts non of this subutex or Methadone BS That just creates an endless loop!!

And the fact that Fetty is actually safer than this Zene shit is ridiculous, these drug laws just escalate to get worse and worse.  TAKE CARE IF YOU ARE GONNA TAKE OPIATES TRY GET GENUINE BLISTER PACK OXY AND NEVER TOUCH LOOSE PILL OPIOIDS ",1cov83p
OpiatesRecovery,Tapering dirty 30s is so hard but I'm doing it,"After a severe back/hip injury in 2016, I went two years suffering before starting to use.  But I quickly found myself doing like 25 per day, dirty 30s, through the nasal cavity.  I would get a batch that was good and I could start tapering, then I would get a batch that was shit and I'd have to do twice as much just to feel ok. I could NOT for the life of me stop doing one every 2 hours or I would start to feel ice cold and all the body pains coming back.  This went on for a few years.  In January I decided to start trying to taper and lower my dose for real.    

I tried Suboxone Bernese method of induction.  It didn't work, but putting myself into minor PWDs every day for 10 days sure helped my tolerance.  I was able to re-establish at 15 per day. 

Then I got myself down to 10 a day by counting the hours and making myself wait an extra hour or two before dosing.  This was way harder than it should have been.  

I remember this battle when I tapered from suboxone last time, it's like a constant war that you're fighting against yourself not to use.  And it lasts weeks, months, sometimes years.  

But I finally got myself down to about 7-8 pills for the last 4-5 days, which is amazing coming from 25 per day.   I can finally sleep a full night without waking up after 3 hours needing to use.  I'm finally feeling the normal WD start to kick in after sleeping 8 hours and it feels good that this shit is leaving my body.  

I just reduced my dose down to 3/4 of a pill every 3-4 hours and after two weeks of stretching out the 3/4 pill to 4-6 hours hopefully, I'm going to go down to 1/2 pill and start stretching out the doses on that.  In another month I should be down to 4-5 pills per day.  In 2 months I hope to get below 3 pills per day.   

Wish me luck, using these pills has wrecked havoc on my mental health and I'm desperate to get off this shit.  ",1cp2pvr

OpiatesRecovery,From good to bad,"Well.. I have recently gotten clean again after a year long bender.  this time it cost my my fiance and two dogs.  BUT being out of the toxicity that was that relationship, and having a clear head on my shoulders I've been feeling pretty great.  But then it happened.  So during the break up my severely unstable ex contacted every friend, family member, and co worker i had and spun massively untrue stories.  I had to move out over night and spend roughly2.5 weeks putting out fires.  Here's the thing, I'm a therapist that works in addiction, and she finally contacted my job.  I had a director and HR people come pull me out of team staffing meeting.  Make me leave immediately to take a drug test(and blow for booze 0.00% obviously) or be terminated that was my option.  I've been placed on leave and am waiting for HR to contact me for a meeting.  This isn't just a job, this has been something I worked for and built in my recovery(5 years before this relapse) and if I lose my license to practice, there's no getting it back.  Also my reputation is essentially ruined now.  She literally has attempted to dismantle every aspect of my life, and i'm still clean.  I have to remember the limits I pushed here to for a year with my addiction behavior.  I take responsibility but still... I think she went too far.  Guys and Gals.. remember.. relapsing and using.. it only takes from us.  There is never a positive outcome and as you build a life back and then lose it all again?  Well it stings more than anything i've experienced in my life.  I'll survive, adjust, and figure something out.  Using those good old addict survival skills.  But man, this was a gut punch.  I thought i was finally free of both her and my habit.  Turns out she still had a little vengeance left in the tank.  Just needed to type this out.   thanks for reading.",1cotat8
OpiatesRecovery,25 days clean and for the first time I realise I'm an addict,"Nearly 1 month away from dope and oxy. I'm starting to get perpetually scared that I've done permanent damage. I have only kicked once before and that was oxy and it was like a walk in the park. 

It's like this time it's in reverse, as the days go by I lose a thread, a thread that I'm hanging on to for dear life whereas before, as the days went by, I could feel each symptom fading away. 

What am I doing to help myself? Nothing. I want to do everything I can but I'm living in this constant and I mean constant fight or flight mode. I have never felt depression or anxiety or fear like this, to the point I ignore a knock at the door and my phones are off and I haven't left my place since day 1. I'm sleep deprived, clamy, my stomach hurts and opiates are on my mind 24/7. If I do get 15 minutes sleep, I wake up in this horrible and scared state. I can feel my heart beating and cortisol running through my veins. 

Maybe I got a free pass on the first time I kicked. Maybe this is actual opiate withdrawal. My head hurts from being trapped inside it and not having anything else to do. 

I was meal prepping and hitting the gym on day 3 onwards last time. This time I need to drag myself to the shower even. 

MAT isn't an option for me, no opiates are. If I somehow make it out of this I want to return to state level bodybuilding. I've cut off all comfort meds but I'm going to give Clonidine a go as soon as I press post. I read on here it can help lower the adrenaline levels. 

I miss the people I love so badly but I cannot see them given the circumstances. Maybe it's better that way. 

Ask me if I was an addict 2 months ago and I probably would have been triggered and deny it but I've had nothing but time for self reflection of my decisions over the years and all roads lead to Rome. ",1coo13d

OpiatesRecovery,Day day 3! I belive going cold turkey off codine! ,"The last dose of codine that I took was on Wednesday around 420mg of codine in the morning around 10am GMT, I did to try and get a high but didn't work. I can usually manage withdrawal symptoms at a much lower dose. I was wondering and looking online when will the peak effects of the withdrawal subside? 

I did fail at day 3 because of the sweating, anxiety and nausea. I belive day 4 most of the withdrawal effects will subside? I want to get rid of this HORRIBLE opiod out of my system and never look back. It's causes me financial issues and relationship issues with my marriage.

 I would love some motivation if anyone can give me an ego boost to get through this. I've been taking codine for atlest 8 months on and off and it's got to the point where I obviously have to take it everyday to normal.

I've bought Asprin, Cold and flu medication containing paracetamol, and night nurse containing paracetamol and also 
diarrhea tablets 

My problem is now hot and cold shivers and and also my appetite has completely subsided.

OpiatesRecovery,Day 9 - weakness,"Damn! Day 9 - and I’ve been so f&$king fatigued today. 
Legs aching, no energy, motivation to work non-existent. 
I don’t want to put it on the withdrawal, I know I’ve let the hydration side of things down and I’m sure that’s what it is, but the games my mind plays. 

These symptoms, which will come up in life anyway, now are immediately caused by my not taking opioids. And taking opioids would of course make them go away. Regardless if they’re being missing is the cause or not. 

I can’t wait until I can simply forget about this shit. 

On the plus side, I can’t honestly say that I’ve never felt so committed, and there were barely any cravings beyond a few when I got home from work and now, on reflection. 

Thanks for listening. It really helps to put it all done here.

OpiatesRecovery,Really Trying to Quit Opioids,"Hello, 

This is my first time ever posting on here, I been an opiod user for little over 10 years. It started when i broke my neck c-4-c7 fusion surgery and was prescribed them, like anyone i took them as told. I dealt with a vigorous rehab trying to maintain living with a broken neck. I did pretty good with them for while  never really over took them, then in 2019 my parents got very sick and i was basically the main caregiver, during that period with all the stress and craziness involved with dealing with a 2 aging parents i really started to go in on the opioids just to feel calmer.  Both my parents died a year apart 2021 then 2022. For the last 2 years i have really depended on opioids (oxys) to make me feel normal. i have spent countless amount of money to buy them off people and im so sick of playing this game going as far sometime to tell my wife i had to pay a bill only to spend all that money on buying enough oxys to get me through a weekend. My family is unaware of this problem ive been having Ive been good at putting that mask on showing everyone im normal. But i think this is it  i really feel like ive hit rock bottom just angry at myself for letting it get this far.  Im on day 4 of no oxys and i don't fell great but these posts have really given me the motivation to keep going,",1cnzrvb

I’ve decided if I am ever going to be the person I day dream about I need to man up and face my first obstacle in life head on, my experience from last time is that the physical part actually really isnt as bad as what I was expecting but the mental part was worse than I was expecting. Opiates don’t make me feel anything even after 2 weeks off all opiates it just didn’t give me that wow I’m going to give up my whole life for this feeling but when I envision my future and my future family I know I will give up everything in this world for them and I need to start that now to ever get to my goals.

I just wish I could get all of this behind me. I quit IV heroin like 10 years ago but I had to move across the country and leave all my friends and family to be successful. At this point in my life with a good career a wife, son, and mortgage I’m not really in a position to just leave everything.

OpiatesRecovery,"Things get better, good luck to everyone","I (37M) don't usually post, but I've been lurking on reddit for a long time.  I just wanted to say that getting clean is possible and that things definitely can get better.  I've been an addict for many years (15+) but the last year or so things got really bad for me with my DOC, painkillers.  I was in so deep, smoking approximately 500 mg of pills a day.  Did so many pills I feel lucky to be alive with Fentanyl around these days.  I knew I needed help stopping but didn't even know where to start between running a business and being there for my family.  I always thought I'd just be a functioning addict, I was very good at it.  But as my usage increased 4-5 fold, I completely ran out of money, spending hundreds of dollars a day.  I knew my luck was going to run out.  About ten days ago, my wife caught me (again) smoking a pill.  Like the dum addict I am I could have waited ten more minutes and wouldn't have gotten caught.  It was a blessing.  I finally admitted I had a problem and needed help (which she knew).  

I've been off pills for 7 days now with the help of MAT.  My life is infinitely better already.  I've been interested in recovery for so long and now I feel so blessed for the opportunity.  I don't know if I'll ever be fully sober, I don't really plan on quitting smoking (weed) or drinking but I know I can never go back to doing hard drugs.  

I just know how dark my life was getting and I didn't ever think things will get better.  My story is probably pretty tame compared to others but for anyone that is struggling please know that things can get better.  With the right mindset and the right support, anything is possible.  Good luck to all, you guys got this.  Happy to chat if anyone needs someone to listen.  ",1co05cx

OpiatesRecovery,Urgent Vivitrol pills question - ANY help please 🙏🏻❣️,"So I’m currently on the pills (gonna switch to the monthly shot after I get a long term health issue fixed and stabilized - unrelated to any drug use, started when I was a child), but anyways  I had a rough time this week and I broke/ gave in, and didn’t take my vivitrol pill today. Instead I went and got 2 dirty 30s and railed them up instantly. It was an impulse decision (obviously, as we all addicts know how easy a relapse and an urge can come on even after weeks/months of feeling fine).

My question is - if I currently no long had physical dependency on opiates and was taking vivitrol regularly for a couple months+ , can I resume taking it tomorrow without dropping into acute withdrawals? I mean scientifically the logic is there, it kicks out and rips all the synthetics opioids binders and binds itself to the receptors in our brain instead of them dirty ones, but if I was not dependent on them physically, I shouldn’t feel any extreme side effects right? Just basically all the euphoria experienced from them today will be instantly gone and might feel lousy and shit mood, but not like full blown hot-cold sweats and shaking and RLS and puking my guts out…right? Or am I just really delusional about how this all works and about to board the train tomorrow to hell??

Anyone knows? Even if you’re not 100% sure and it’s not medicallly confirmed or researched - just any words of encouragement or tales from personal experiences with a similar situation would be very helpful, because I don’t want to even THINK about not taking my vivitrol tomorrow morning because without taking one and knowing/assuring myself I can’t get high even if I really wanted to - I’ll be a loose cannon and the temptation tomorrow to go and have another “good” (faked and not authentic) day will be so so strong, I really want to believe I’ve gotten stronger this time around after getting clean but again I don’t trust myself (or my whacked out brain) at all, ever, when it comes to these little shits. 


Anyone know? Please and thank you. Kudos to anyone who has managed to stay clean today. Big hug to all of y’all from me. Even y’all who broke or had a lapse or a step back or a full blown relapse for a few month. We all just trying and doing our best even if our best is a relapse and then detoxing again. It’s all part of the process. We just gotta keep trying as discouraging as this all sounds.

OpiatesRecovery,Suboxone dosage?,"Hello everyone! Hope you're all doing well.

I'm in MAT for the first time because I had a consistent although somewhat small H habit going which got a bit difficult to deal with. I just got my third dose of suboxone sublingually. For the first day they're apparently only allowed to give 4 mg plus another 4 mg an hour or so later to make sure there's no precipitated withdrawal.

I had around 48 hours between my last H dose and the subs so I was pretty sure I'd be fine since my doc said waiting for around 3 half-lives would suffice.

On the second day I got my dose increased to 12 mg and once again to 16 mg today. I was wondering if this dosage/scheme is acceptable and whether it's common or not. I dealt with some minor nausea today and yesterday, but that seems to have mostly subsided. I've had no cravings nor withdrawal related symptoms which is awesome, and I fully intend to never again touch H or any other opiates. So far so good.

I'm a terrible person during wd, and probably worse completely without. I've tried to quit so many times, but I always give up around day 3. I tried tapering down with my neurologist instructing me how to take it, but I really can't remember how it went. I'm afraid what it would be like. It's been sooo long since I've been ""sober.""

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and depression before Tramadol. I was an alcoholic before that. Got meds for it (can't remember what, but Prodin was one of them). 2 months into them, I was just a shell of myself. My family made me stop because they in short they don't believe in invisible mental illnesses.

Honestly, I think I am a better person on Tramadol, but my lower back (something inside there on that spot) just aches. I think it's my liver or kidneys crying out for help.  I have seizures when I accidentally OD, and now I have severe memory problems.

My question is about money for recovery. I don’t know what she’s been spending but I know she’s struggling financially. A worker in my Canadian province said subloxone is $20-30/day. In this subreddit though people speak of MAT being an intermittent or shorter term thing(?)

My question is what could I tell her about the options for getting off with medicated help. It seems dangerous to go cold turkey (lower tolerance, then overdose risk).

Thanks for any insight. $30/day for many months seems steep…

OpiatesRecovery,Why is this so hard still,"I’m not very far in, only on day 7 from getting off suboxone film. I had been on it for 6 years about before this cessation, on around 4-6 mg a day. I was taking 1mg doses for a long time before tapering down to 2mg, 1 in the morning 1 in the evening. Then to 1 mg in the morning only.

I am still in so much hell though with crippling anxiety and bouts of depression. The depression was expected, and I think I can handle that for the most part. It’s the feeling in my chest that I need to claw it open to stop this feeling that’s causing my legs and body to jerk and shake. My knees are bruised from clenching during intense attacks, and my whole body sore from the same. I can’t sleep when it’s all I want to do and every minute feels like 10.

How much longer will this anxiety continue? Will it ever go way? I really am feeling beat down about this and don’t feel I’m mentally strong enough to break through this. My brain hurts and it makes my body twitch and nothing makes it go away",1cn2ckt
OpiatesRecovery,Comment on: Why is this so hard still,"So word on the street is that a device called the ""bridge"" is in testing which is a wearable that somehow mitigates withdrawal symptoms and cravings. A buddy of mine has applied to participate in a clinical trial of it through Johns Hopkins. Hopefully my buddy gets in to the study and does not get the control device. It seems to have good results so far. 

There is also ibogaine which is some kind of hallucinogen (I think) that people have had seemingly miraculous experiences with and which is available outside the US. 

The problem I see with American pharma and healthcare in general is that health itself is purposefully not decoupled from a profit motive. That is, from a business standpoint pharma companies are incentivized to invest in medicines that people take for the rest of their lives or for a really really long time- because these medications are profitable. It doesn't make any money to straight up cure somebody quickly when instead the patient could be paying for a long while. 

On the other hand, if people weren't taking Lipitor (nothing against blood pressure medicine just using it as an example) or suboxone (again it is clearly morally better for somebody to be on subs forever rather than die from fentanyl if that is the choice we're looking at) or whatever else, every day forever, the companies would not have as much money available to work on other drugs that improve and save lives (like vaccines etc. for example). So it's complicated but I feel like ethically a company (be it health insurance or pharma etc) shouldn't be allowed to make money off of the sick. This was a specific US policy decision made in the 70s and I believe it to be very immoral personally. Anyway. I gotta go be productive I hope everybody has a great day! We do recover!",l35qtw8

alcoholism,Seeking Advice: Overcoming Misunderstandings and Alcohol Issues Abroad,"I moved from a country in the Middle East to the US 9 months ago on a full scholarship to attend a prestigious liberal arts college. My transition has been anything but smooth, and I find myself in need of some guidance and perhaps a bit of empathy.

Since arriving, I've faced numerous challenges, but the most pressing issue has been my struggle with alcohol. My inability to manage my drinking culminated in an unfortunate incident at a college party where I blacked out. While heavily intoxicated, I made someone feel uncomfortable, leading to rumors that I was engaging in inappropriate behavior (sexual harassment). This has severely damaged my reputation at my small college, where such news spreads fast and opinions form quickly.

Despite reaching out and apologizing to those directly involved, the situation has escalated, and I've been ostracized from many community activities in my college, including a Palestine encampment movement I cared deeply about. This has been particularly painful as it taps into stereotypes that don’t reflect who I am or my values.

To address my part in these events, I've started to confront my relationship with alcohol. I've committed to abstaining from drinking and am seeking professional help to understand and control my habits better. This is a significant step for me, especially coming from a conservative family that has thankfully shown understanding and support amidst these trials.

However, the social isolation and accusations have made my college experience incredibly tough. I’m struggling with loneliness, stress, and a tarnished reputation that feels impossible to rebuild. As a freshman, it's disheartening to see my academic and social life crumble around me. I only know a few people who believe me and truly understand what happened.

I’m reaching out to this community for advice on how to navigate this complex situation. How do you rebuild your life in a new place when you feel like everything is against you? Any guidance on managing false accusations or rebuilding your social life after such incidents would be immensely helpful.

alcoholism,Tapering to Avoid Withdrawals,"Hello,

I saw the rule about not asking for medical advice, which I don't think I am since I'm asking about tapering and the best way to get to 0 and quit while avoiding withdrawal, but apologies if I broke that rule and post gets removed. Anyway...

I feel embarrassed for posting because I know I'm probably being dramatic but my anxiety gets the best of me so here it goes. I usually have a few beers a night, I'd say anywhere from 2-4 per night and I work a 9-5 so I don't usually drink before 6pm or after 10pm. Lately I've been trying to keep it to 2-3. I'm kind of losing the urge to drink and would like to take a break from it after drinking almost everyday for the past 2 or 2 1/2 years (it doesn't affect my life other than having alcoholics in my family, like a case a day type, and not wanting to end up down that route).

All that being said, I'm terrified of withdrawal symptoms (mainly the seizures and hospital stuff). I have some pretty bad health anxiety that developed during COVID (another reason I want to stop) so I'm so afraid of bad withdrawals, I can handle not getting great sleep but don't want the bad stuff. Do you think I have anything to worry about since I only have 2-4 beers a night? Should I taper down to 2 a night and then 1 a night over the next week and then stop? Sorry for sounding silly, but again, my anxiety gets the best of me. Thanks for any advice.",1cowzfq
alcoholism,"I am 8 months sober, and debating throwing it away.","I know these are the times that are trying, that we're supposed to persevere, but I'm just... not seeing the point in saving my own life anymore. Even when I try my hardest, everything falls apart and the worst of the worst continues to happen despite my strength, and I've simply broken this time, completely, more than ever before. 

I recently broke up with my ex, moved an hour and a half away from my home town all alone... One of my cats got out. I found her body yesterday and I'm not okay at all. I believe she starved to death and that makes me sick. She was very close to my house.... It could've ended so much differently, so much better... I'm shredded emotionally. My ex has been still seeing me, sleeping with me, etc and decided that now that this has happened, it's the perfect time to abandon me completely, with almost no explanation of why. I'm sure he must've just met someone new and is cutting me off without telling me to trail me along in case that doesn't work, but I am ... in shock. The thing is, this cruelty on top of losing my kitty is more than I can seem to take. I've been staunchly determined never to drink again and haven't even felt tempted this way since I stopped drinking, but now, I feel as though there's simply no point in continuing my life. It doesn't matter. It really just.... doesn't matter. We all die cruelly alone in the end, why am I trying so hard? I could just go to sleep. I could just give up. I could just take another drink and drown myself until this is over. And why not? I hate my life, I hate my job, I hate myself, and I everyone around me hates me, too. I failed my innocent little kitty and this is karma for being a bad person my entire life. I just want to be done with it all, and I know I won't have the balls unless I break my sobriety, but I suspect I already have cirhossis anyway (15 years of daily vodka will do that). 8 Months sober and what has it gotten me? I've lost everything since I've gotten sober, and I just sit here and feel it all and suffer, and for what? FOR WHAT? 

Sorry. I know this isn't the best place, cuz other people are trying to be better than me and they have an actual shot, but I know that things aren't going to get better anymore, even if I stay sober. I just want to go be with my kitty, and my mom. I just want to step through the veil.

alcoholism,Quitting drinking need help/advice,"I’m almost 34 and have drank heavily on an off since being 21. I quit for a long time. From 23-29. Got in a relationship and began slowly drinking again at 30 and have been pretty much drinking most days of the year for the last 2 years. I had a lot of things happen in life: breakup and loss of big tech job due to layoffs, followed by my brother’s unexpected passing from coming into contact with fentanyl. We had no idea and neither did he. Then my mother died last fall from drinking and doing drugs her whole life. 

I just quit my job as a barback because I’m of the drinking and the fighting and just being taken advantage of. Since I am no longer around that lifestyle and job I really want to quit drinking. I’ve noticed GI issues, pains and itching but nothing past that. I drink beer. Usually about a 6 pack a night. 

I have not tried cold turkey for fear of what might happen but I am willing to try it. I have a 12 pack in my fridge but I don’t drink during the day. I drink a ton of water, do fasting, and try to eat healthy. I just drink at night but still. I can tell my body is telling me to chill out. 

What has been other people’s journey if there is s similar one? Also, I do take medications for other stuff. For over a decade now. I come from a family of alcoholics and my mother died from liver cancer from drugs and alcohol. She was 62. My dad passed when I was 25 from a blood clot that turned to DVT and ruptured in his lungs. 

I don’t want any of this lifestyle anymore. I just don’t know how to get started. I have set up an appointment with my family doctor next Thursday to have my bloodwork done and to talk about all of this. But until then I don’t want to keep drinking like this.

alcoholism,Is my wife right ?,"I have had a mixed relationship with alcohol my life, generally I only drink monthly at most and mostly beer and do not have a dependency at all, however, in previous years when I do drink on occasion I would often drink in excess and become unaware of what I am doing /saying or my actions.  This has resulted is severely bad episodes which has put our marriage on the rocks.  October last year I went to an AA assesment and agreed with the guy assessing me that I would implement a hard drink limit, only drink 5 pints of larger in a 24hr period no more than that.  This over the past 6 months has worked well, on occasion I did go over by 2 pints as was drinking over a longer period with 4/5 HR breaks between the first 2 and the following 5.  Recently my wife was away on a trip and I bought 4 beers to drink at home , I drink the 4 beers and wanted another drink but only had gin and so I poured myself (a very strong) gin which caused a spiral and I ended up drunk and asleep on the sofa when she returned.  I screwed up a limit that I put in place and ruined it.  A further AA meeting the lady said I'm not going to tell you what to do but have you considered giving up alcohol all together? I said I had thought of it and don't like the idea.  I want another chance to stick to the limit again , my wife is concerned that I can't bear the thought of never drinking again and at least still being able to have a ""few"" drinks.  I like drinking, I don't like drinking in excess and want to control it.  She is likely to end the marriage and leave with my 3 kids if I don't stop drinking completely. I will do that if it comes to it but I really don't want to of course , should I still be trying to control it , put a hard limit and definitely learn from my mistake and never touch a spirit again ?  In my mind I am confident this time that I will keep to it strictly.  My wife is fair to not have faith as I have tried in the past and not totally stuck to it.  She also asked me why I ""like"" to drink and my response was I like the feeling it gives me, she said that is an abnormal response and is an alcoholics response , in my head it's a pritty normal response ... Why does anyone drink ? I would assume for that reason exactly ...My head is giving me conflict and I need clarity and a non bias opinion. Thanks in advance",1corznc
alcoholism,I am going to finally go to treatment tomorrow,"I’m going to a treatment center tomorrow

Long post:
I’ve never admitted this to anyone before, but I’ve been drinking beer every single night for at least 5 years (I’m in my late twenties) It’s gotten progressively worse to the point that I’m drinking almost if not more than a case a day. I’ve got plenty of things that I could offer as BS excuses but I know it’s 100% on me. I’ve always tried to convince myself that I have the willpower to quit or at least cut it back, but I very obviously don’t. I’ve known this for a long time but just keep on doing it. When I’m at work I’m always thinking about when I can get off and drink beer. It feels like my life revolves around alcohol and I’m just so tired of it. I’m embarrassed and ashamed to tell my family that I need rehab, but it needs to happen. They’re always concerned about me which is completely justified, and I feel terrible about that and am so damn nervous to call them but it’s what I’ve got to finally do.

I’m new to the sub, I’d greatly appreciate any advice. I’m so anxious to finally make that necessary leap to sobriety. ",1cocoia
alcoholism,Is my dad an alcoholic?,"Here out of curiosity of my father's drinking habits. He's 59 years old, and is a true 80s guy through and through, sometimes I think he thinks it's still 1985. He loves rock n', football, mowing grass, grilling, etc. If you watch King of the Hill and can imagine Hank Hill, he's basically the cartoon version of my dad. He is extremely fit for his age, runs miles per day, lifts weights, and eats extremely healthfully. He is 6'1 and weighs 192 pounds, super lean. He was a college football player, then a police officer, and now works 7am-4pm M-F manufacturing medical equipment. I love the dude to pieces and he is single handedly the most self-disciplined person I know. He keeps up on doctor's appointments and has perfectly healthy blood work and is not on any prescription medications except a shot he gets every few months for tendinitis in his elbow.

So now that the picture is painted, let me also say that the man likes to have a good time. He drinks Miller Lites pretty much every Saturday. He sits outside, listens to his music, hangs out with his family and friends, and drinks beer. He can put away about 9-10 beers in a night and be at a really fun level of buzzed but he really doesn't get super drunk. Sometimes, he'll drink his first beer or two and then say he's ""Not feeling it tonight"" and won't go any further. Other times, he'll drink his first beer or two and then say ""Oh yeah, they're going down easy tonight"" and then the party rolls on. I know he had some heavy partying days back in like I said, the 80s... But now his weekend enjoyment and ""partying"" comes down to Miller Lites on Saturdays. Is this problematic? I know 9-10 in a night is excessive, but I also like to think he ""deserves it"" and if that's the worst thing he does in life, I just want to say ""Who cares, let the man live"".

I do worry about the toll this might take on his health, but as it stands now, he's extremely healthy with no major concerns at all. He also doesn't drink multiple days in a row, in fact has a very strict rule against it unless he's on vacation. He also has a rule about not drinking on holidays, which I've always found kind of funny since it's the opposite of what most people do. He will occasionally drink Guinness instead of Miller Lite, but Miller Lite is definitely his preference. He's really a legend of a dude and I know he looks forwards to his Saturdays every week and works hard for them. I just want to know if at almost 60 years old, it's too much. It really doesn't cause any major issues in his life and he always says ""If the doctor told me tomorrow I could never drink again, I wouldn't."" He did participate in Dry January this year but I'm pretty sure has drank every weekend except one or two since then.

alcoholism,How can we help my sister? Asking for lived experience,"My (30F) sister (36F) is an alcoholic (drinking roughly one bottle of vodka a day). She still lives with my parents, and when she drinks (which usually starts by around 2pm every day), she becomes the most horrible person. She is abusive to my mother every day, usually comments like “you’re the worst mother in the world”, “everyone wishes you were dead” “you’re a disgusting excuse for a human”. She calls her every name under the sun, and this just goes on and on every night. My mom cries herself to sleep every night. I haven’t visited my mom’s house in months because we don’t want to see my sister, neither have my two brothers or my other sister. 

She refuses to admit she has a problem. Tells everyone that she only drinks occasionally and not that much. When she’s actively drunk will claim that she’s not despite not being unable to stand up straight and can barely speak. I know that at the end of the day, nothing can be done until she makes the choice to, but how do we get her to see she has an issue? 

I got married 6 months ago and said that if she chose to drink at my wedding that would be the end of our relationship. She missed the ceremony and showed up three hours late, and was absolutely trashed - couldn’t even stand, and then went from table to table drinking peoples leftover glasses because I’d asked the bar staff not to serve her. I really thought that knowing her relationship with me would be over would be enough to not drink for one day, but I just feel like if she is willing to say goodbye to a relationship with her own sister over alcohol, it’s just hard for me to see how she still can’t acknowledge that she has a problem. We actually haven’t spoken since. 

In all honesty, the current living situation with my parents is not sustainable. She has now moved on to hitting our mom (on multiple occasions). I am at a point where I have said to my mom I think she needs to kick her out, but she has no friends (because she has alienated everyone with her behaviour) and no where to go, so will essentially become homeless. Obviously no one wants this, but it feels like we are reaching a point where there is no other option. Every night I worry that she will kill my mom in a burst of rage. It’s not safe. 

I guess I’m not sure what my question is, i just worry about my mom. For those who’ve been there and out the other side, would being kicked out to homelessness have been a wake up call? Or would it make things worse? She cant live with my mum. I can’t take her in (mainly because I don’t want her here), but I also have a son at home and wouldn’t want her around him when drunk.

alcoholism,I’m 22F. Are there any other young women here that have recognized their problem?,"I’m pretty sure I am an alcoholic, or a least my lifestyle presents as me being one. Sometimes it’s lonely. Most people imagine a middle age man when they think about alcoholism. But I never hear about young women like me. I know how bad it is for my health to already be an alcoholic this young, and as a woman alcohol damages our bodies more so than men. I binge drink nearly every day of the week at this point. Often alone. I’ve taken on somewhat of a “party girl” persona as a defense mechanism. Many people I hang around with know I drink a lot but don’t know how much.

My problem is that I don’t have support from

It’s been extremely hard going through rehab aa/na alone
Many of relapsed are caused by family as well.

And I relapsed yesterday… with a aa goer…. I did tell her no first but she nagged and nagged me to come out. And so I eventually did… nothing bad or crazy happened. I’m just in this I’m

alcoholism,Fighting two demons at the same time is exhausting,"I dunno what I'm doing here, TBH. I might just be venting so it's out of my head. Or maybe I'm passively seeking advice.

Long time alcoholic here. I'm a 35 M with no kids or anything. It's just me. I had never attempted to get sober before because I didn't really recognize I had a problem until a few years ago. At that point, I was just ignoring it and trying to manage. I managed to find this realization without getting arrested or hospitalized but eventually realized I needed to make some changes. Over the past 6 months, I made a number of smart moves. I left my comfort zone of bartending. I put myself into an intensive outpatient rehab and sought treatment. I gained a lot from it. I cut ties with my friends who I know we likely not going to shift to a recovery mindset or at the very least be supportive of my recovery. I started shifting my whole being toward trying to recover and being sober. I started to like who I was again for the first time in years. As of today, I've been sober 62 days.

With just myself here, I'm finding this really difficult to maintain though. My social circle is almost non-existent as a result of the changes I've made. And I am once again trying to fight off being homeless (that's the second demon I'm trying to battle). I had to leave my last living situation abruptly because of an alcoholic roommate with serious psychosis. I found a new place a few months ago hoping to be able to get things on track finally. I started a new job that pays pretty decently. I've been paying off my debt and working hard. But because I've been recovering from a financially vulnerable  position, I don't have much saved. The owner of the house I'm at is selling the house and I don't have much time to find somewhere else.

All I see is the walls closing in on me, and I have no idea what to even do. I don't have family who can/will help and I've already leaned on the few friends I have as much as I can. I'm not a part of any meetings or recovery community outside the IOP I went to over the last few months. I feel despair over my situation. I feel despair over the fact that things have only really gotten harder since I've been sober despite making the right moves. And I feel despair that despite all the coping mechanisms and skills I've learned, my go-to reaction is still to get hammered. I've been fighting max level cravings pretty frequently with all my willpower. I know drinking will not improve this situation, yet I don't know where to find solace. I'm hoping I can maintain the strength and courage to keep on this path sober. But I don't know if I can. I thought the first few weeks of being with withdraw was the hardest. It was hard but...No, it's this right now. When the going gets tough and all you wanna do is default back to what you've always done.  It'd just be nice to relax a bit. But this is the price one pays when they fuck around for a decade getting hammered and partying instead of building toward the future. I own that. I just hope it gets a bit easier. I really don't wanna go back to where I was.",1cnyvjz
alcoholism,What is considered safe?,"I’ve struggled with my alcoholism for years and i met my current boyfriend while in a deep state of one of my worst binge drinking episodes. i go through episodes i’ll lightly drink everyday to downing half a bottle every hour for a week straight.since  i met my boyfriend he encouraged me to quit which i haven’t done in a long time, so i did and it worked out really well for me, then only with him i drank a small cup of wine which felt safe because my cravings weren’t as severe and i knew i was with him and that he could control how much i have due to him being the one pouring the drink. now recently me and him took shots for cinco de mayo and i got drunk. i felt nice knowing i have slowly eased into drinking controllably again and not having an episode. what i want to know is if it’s okay that i drink lightly on the occasion to prevent an episode or is it too risky. my birthday is coming up and my friends wanted to go out for drinks but im too nervous that im going to be too impulsive and drink too much. i’m not sure what’s safe,  like today i felt stressed so i wanted a drink but i don’t know if it’s safe or not.

alcoholism,"Being sober: it´s a journey through a spiral, not a straight line - at least for me","Just wanted to let all of you struggling with getting and staying sober know my perspective on this:

when I first realized I was an alcoholic I thought that it would be a simple matter of stopping to drink once and then not touch alcohol ever again. While that would be the most desirable way for me I quickly found out it doesn´t work like that, at least not for me and I suppose many others on this journey struggle with the same problems.

I´ve had various relapses and slip ups in my journey where I simply couldn´t resist certain situations and drank (in secret). When this happened to me for the first time, it naturally led to me being devastated thinking I´d failed and all those many days where I stayed absolutely sober and resisted temptations where completly worthless. What took me some time and reading other´s experiences to understand was that my journey is more like going through a spiral instead of a straight line. That means, at least for me, it´s ok to have bad days, to have days where I´ve caved in as long as those days only strengthen my resolve to be sober afterwards and help me realize that I don´t, in fact, either like nor need alcohol anymore and my life is much better without drinking stuff that I don´t like the taste of anymore and that makes me feel incredibly bad once the ""positive"" effects wear off.

I guess where I´m going with this post is this: accept that you may make mistakes on YOUR path but don´t let them get you down or be your excuse to throw all that you´ve already managed out the window. Keep on keeping on and eventually you´ll reach the point where you´re completely free of your self-made prison.",1cnq7qg
alcoholism,I’m a musician and a teacher.,To keep the conversation short… I feel like both jobs encourage me to drink.

alcoholism,What does alcoholism FEEL like?,"I’m 25 and very wary of addiction because I feel like I have an addictive type of personality. 

For the most part, I’m not a heavy drinker at all. Normally, drink only on occasion, and with the exception of a party here and there, don’t normally get drunk.

However, recently I discovered I really like how a little Evan Williams flavors things like coffee, tea, hot chocolate. 

I work from home, don’t drink coffee daily, but when I do, I enjoy putting a little Evan Williams in. I don’t even pour a full shot, just a little taste.

Now I’m finding that sometimes I get a hankering for my Evan Williams coffee. It’s not very intense, more like a feeling of “it would be nice to taste this little treat”. I imagine it would be easy to resist this temptation, but because I work from home, I don’t really have a reason to. 

I’m still not doing this daily, more like multiple days a week, but I’m worried that this is becoming a habit. I’m worried that me “enjoying the flavor” is just my brain finding a way to get its little alcohol fix in the morning.

I realize I’m still a long way off from alcoholism, but I’m very wary of teaching my brain any kind of alcohol habits, no matter how small, because I realize how easy it is for me to get carried away with things. 

What does alcoholism feel like for you? Do you think I’m overthinking my enjoyment of the Evan Williams coffee, or is it possible that enjoying the taste of it could go wrong? 

When I ask how does alcoholism feel, I’m talking about what does the craving feel like? Is it more like you’re craving the feeling of being drunk, or could it feel like you’re craving the taste of your drink of choice? ",1co2qgb
alcoholism,What are the chances that my Mom will come back from her disease?,"Hello. To cut to the chase, my Mom has been recently diagnosed with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (Wet Brain) & encephalopathy.

About 14 days ago my Mom was hallucinating. She thought I was in her home (I live 400 miles away), and she was talking about spending time with relatives who have been deceased for some time— even decades ago.

An ambulance took her to the hospital and after an MRI, the nurses confirmed with me her diagnosis.

My Aunt (her sister) speculates that WKS was in effect long before the hallucinations/confusion became worse.

As of today, she thinks she’s in Oregon and that the year is currently 2007. She doesn’t remember anything other than her name and birth date. She’s not even sure if she has children let alone couldn’t remember our birthdates when I last asked her over the phone.

My Mom is an alcoholic. I can’t tell you how long she’s been drinking in my 32 years of being alive (still, a lot), however, she’s been drinking every day since 2021.

So I have a few questions.. now that she’s been in a hospital and currently a rehab facility, she has to have been sober for some days now. Will she come out of the WKS (wet brain)?
Do you think this is beyond reversible since it’s been a while before she got help?
Will her life expectancy be shortened due to WKS?

Additional info: Her teeth are rotten and she hardly ate so she was malnourished. She’d hardly drink water. She drank hard liquor and beer. So much as she’d start drinking at 3am if she could make it to the fridge for a beer without falling down (she suffers from neuropathy and can’t walk well/can’t feel her feet or hands).",1cno1w3
alcoholism,How do I deal with my dad and his girlfriend’s alcoholism ,"I’m defeated. Exhausted. My (f29) dad (m65) is an alcoholic. He always has been but he was “functional” even though that term drives me crazy. 

He’s always had a terrible temper even when sober, but he is nearly disabled from arthritis in his hip that he’ll need a replacement for, and everyday that he pushes the surgery off and is constantly in pain and miserable, he drinks more. I don’t want to blame it all on the hip because he’s always drank too much, but his temper has gotten way worse as well and so I think it’s one big shitty combo of everything and it makes him increase his drinking. 
What’s worse is he used to drink beers but the last several years he drinks straight vodka and can go through entire handles within a few hours. 

The problem now is he’s dating this woman who he lives with who is ALSO an alcoholic. She literally lost her kids over her alcoholism and although she is friendly, she is mentally unstable in the way that she is super sensitive and emotional and it’s exhausting. She has to take hormones to regulate herself mentally to give you an idea. Instead of trying to win custody of her kids back, she moved in with my dad to another state and all they do is fight, drink, make up and repeat. My dad literally lost his job over his drinking last year, and calls out about once a week at his new job, so he’ll probably get fired from this one soon too. 

He’s had two DUIs and even though he’s tried to stop and been successful at times, he always reverts back to it and his girlfriend is a HUGE enabler and is constantly buying alcohol, serving him drinks without asking and refilling his cup all night with wine and mixed drinks. When he tries to stop drinking she argues with him to drink more. It’s sickening. 

My dad has become horrible when he drinks-he’s gotten physically abusive with his girlfriend, he gets in fights with everyone, he’s super paranoid and is convinced she’s cheating and starts freaking out on any guy around us, but yet he’ll attempt to cheat too. Then when he’s sober of course he can’t remember anything and feels terrible. 

They are both the worst people on the planet when they drink. They go from being annoying, to disgusting with overt PDA, to fighting, to avoiding responsibilities and I just wanna hide in a hole and cry because I’m so disgusted having to parent them all they time. 
I’ve had so many talks with both of them and obviously nothing I do or say is working. I’m exhausted and feel so fed up trying to stop the behavior. It’s not my job and I’m disgusted thinking about it. 
Do I just give up and walk away? I don’t want to end the relationship completely but I just don’t see him ever changing and his girlfriend is completely dependent on him so she’s not going anywhere. They are going to be each other’s demise no doubt, and I just can’t take the stress of watching it slowly happen. TIA and please be kind, I’m really hurting. 

TL/DR: My dad and his girlfriend are raging alcoholics and encourage each other’s drinking.  Nothing I do helps. Do I give up trying to help them and just step back in the relationship? Did anything work for you in a similar situation? ",1cnp3qd

alcoholism,One week sober ,"I'm just a week without alcohol, but I'm already seeing the damage done with my life looking back. 

It's like the fog is gone and my mind shows me things that alcohol was masking.

On the day 05/01/24, I decided to start a little project for my health, it is a 50 days challenge without consuming any alcohol. 

I know it's still early, but I've noticed this:

1)My belly is bloated, my face aswelll and full of acne(I don't know why).

2)My heart is getting better each day, because Im not feeling anxious and tired all the time. Blood pressure is getting better each day. 

3)I'm more energetic than i was last week.
Got back to working out at the gym since last June, almost a year, going five times a week. But was drinking at least three times a week, usually 3-4 liters of whiskey, it was holding me back and fucking all the progress.

4)I'm not sure but I'm feeling a bit depressed since then, someone at the gym asked me why I was sad and I've answered that when I was showering the shampoo got into my eyes, yes I've lied.

5)Money saved this week is going to add until I'm done with my 50 days project, in the end I'm going to make a trip and treat myself in the best way I can, without alcohol of course. 

But I'm free to make a choice if I can keep going or not, I'm tired of alcohol and love freedom. 

Getting back to drinking it's not the right thing to do, but whe are not there yet. Future me, please don't have that drink you want so much. 

Am I going to experience worse withdrawal from now on, right? I don't care if its get worse, all I want is to reaching my goal and see how things are going to be when I get there. 

I'm a 30 yo(m), and my drinking started when I was 15. The alcoholic part started to get bad when I was 23. I'm also a smoker for the same amount of time, right now I'm smoking more than 30 cigarettes a day, planned to drop both at once but I wasn't able to do it yet. Guess that drinking will go first and then smoking. 

Im doing this for myself and because I love life and I want to live in a better way. Sobriety might be the best way to conquer my life back, freedom is what I really want. 

I hope it will stick, some people called me to watch the Real Madrid football game today but I'm staying home reading a book or something else.

I wish all you people here that are reading this that:

I have no desire to drink again but I feel guilty about it and like I’ve done something terrible.

I trust myself enough to know I really won’t be tempted to do it again because this shame is overwhelming, but I wish I knew why I felt the need to try it again in the first place. I was telling myself that I needed to let loose and try it now that I’m slightly older. But I’m an addict, my disease lies to me.

alcoholism,Question for those in recovery: partner is becoming very unkind,"I am hoping for insight from people in recovery. What should I say, how should I approach this? I love my partner very much but I also cannot be spoken to or treated the way he has treated me, and it seems linked to his drinking. My apologies this is so long.

I’ve known my boyfriend 18 years, half my life. We moved back in together about 9 months ago. I’m in a very difficult position now, because my career imploded, and he told me he wanted to support me and give me space to grieve and restart my career. We talked about it at length, and he promised me at least a year. We plan on starting a family and came up with a 2 year plan together. I’ve been working hard and am chipping away at our plan. In 4 months I’ll be back on track career-wise and we will be able to save a lot more money and buy a house. 

I didn’t realize how much he was drinking until then. Initially it wasn’t bad, and I absolutely looked the other way. I also feel very guilty and like a burden, even though we did agree to our current situation, and initially was very reluctant to rely on him.

The last 3 months, any time I do something he doesn’t like, he has started to get verbally cruel. Rather than telling me “hey I’m working really hard and do t have time, would you mind cleaning my office?” Or “hey it bothers me if any dishes are out in the morning” He stops talk me to me, drinks, and gets really cruel. Last weekend was the worst. 

 Last weekend he walked out at 11 am acting angry, told me he was just stressed and needed some alone time, and said “don’t worry, it’s a me thing not an us thing,” so I gave him space. We had eaten late the night before, so some dishes were in the sink, I was folding his laundry. And 2 hours later the house was spotless again. Then at 8 pm he was still gone and I asked if he was coming home. 

He had been drinking all day and then told me it was because of me: I’m not meeting his needs, he needs a woman, not a girl. If I can’t get my life together now I’ll never amount to anything. (I was an R&D scientist leading a multimillion dollar project… ). Then at 1 am he asked me to take a 45 minute Uber drive to pick him and his friend up from the bar and drive him home. On the drive home he again blamed me, intimated he was going to end our relationship, and generally blamed me for everything he was feeling. He finally said it was because we had left out our dishes for the morning- the issue was I hadn’t cleaned it up before we went to bed. Things had been great the night before. 

I’m not perfect, and readily accept my partner saying “hey I need this.” But when he’s saying cruel things to me I ask him “okay but what can I do differently? I need you to tell me specifics.” He won’t. 

And when he’s basically sober and we talk we are able to  have mature conversations and work things out. I clean everything, make and serve all his very strict dietary meals, pack lunch, do laundry, deep clean Friday before the weekend so the house is clean for him when he has 2 days off. But if anything is out of place, say the dishwasher is running, I did his meal prep, and there are a few dishes I’ve stacked in the sink to load in the dishwasher once it’s done, and he gets home it’s a trigger. 

He drinks and says I’m a girl, he needs a woman. That I’m difficult, I don’t listen, that if I can’t get my life together with the opportunity he’s given me I never will. That he is constantly having to deal with things not being how he wants. When I ask what he wants he says he can’t articulate it. The things he says really hurt me- and are very toxic- I’ve repeatedly said he can’t talk to me like that, and his (drunk)reply is he will respect me when I deserve respect. 

He’s different when he doesn’t drink so much- the man I fell in love with.

This past Saturday he hurt me immensely- telling me on the ride home how he discussed “everything” with all the friends he has at many bars, with his many friends from the various social clubs he is in. But it’s been almost a week and he refuses to discuss the incident with me.

I’m not perfect, but I am trying so hard. And I think most of these issues are coming out with his recently escalated drinking. But when I try to broach it he shrugs it off. 

How do I take responsibility for the things I do wrong in our relationship, but also bring up how the drinking affects us, and how it affects him? He has repeatedly said he wants to quit but I don’t know how to help, and I can’t move out right now. I don’t drink with him. I bend over backwards to make his life and our home a happy place.

Any insights or actionable suggestions are really welcome. We love each other very much.

alcoholism,Alcohol withdrawal is actually insane,"I think I ended up having withdrawal hallucinations yesterday. Craziest thing is I had a date set up in the evening and I had to sleep it off for most of the day, I’d hear voices for a moment after waking up, took a shower, arrived like 30 minutes late, it was hard to speak normally and I could tell I slurred a little bit and I’d forget what words I’m trying to say sometimes, and somehow ended up hitting it off. But I had to fight like hell to come across like I was doing at least somewhat okay. 

She had a great time though and so did I despite that and she wants to meet again. And I think that’s because we still connected really well. Especially if we do get into a relationship, I’m just not going to drink that poison anymore. Even if we don’t, I’m still done with it. 

That was actually freaking wild going through that and it scared the bajesus out of me. We went on a walk and I was wondering if I was going to fucking die, or have a seizure or something. I became easily out of breath, heart palpitations and rapid heart beat, weird stomach pains, That obviously would’ve traumatized the fuck out of that girl, and would have traumatized me as well. Never experienced anything like that before and honestly I don’t even know how I managed to keep it together. 

The stomach pains and stuff seem to have largely gone away as I write this, they typically do after 24 hours, but they definitely did feel worse this time. My brain largely feels like it’s working properly again, besides the insomnia considering I’m writing this at nearly 4 AM. 

That obviously wasn’t just a hangover and that’s the first time I’ve really experienced that kind of thing. I’ve heard from another thread here that once that starts happening, you’ll never have a normal hangover again. I’ve been drinking 3 hurricanes (8% ABV, 25 fl oz per can) for the last week and didn’t think it was getting me drunk enough to result in this. I’ve stopped drinking for a few months before successfully and this didn’t happen those times. If I drink again, I think I’m just going to check into rehab because that’s obviously not sustainable and I don’t ever want to go through that again. ",1cn1gov

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good day friends! I’m glad to be hosting this week for all you fine people. I hope everybody is having a good week or that it gets better soon. As we approach the weekend I know this is a tough time for many of us who primarily drink on the weekends. 

So before we get there I want to take a minute and reflect on how I used to ‘reward’ myself with drinking on my weekend. I worked all week and now it’s time to party. Now it’s time to relax and have a couple drinks with my friends. Or maybe there’s a sporting event and I’m going to go drink beers there. But it never ended with just those innocuous events. 

My drinking was drink before I left the house. Drink as soon as I get there. Don’t stop drinking after I get home. And then black out at some point and wake up the next day really confused. That’s not normal drinking. Normal drinkers don’t black out and forget most of their evenings. 

Now my weekends are fully remembered. I can still go out with friends. Or go to a sporting event. I can go get a workout in. I can prepare a new dinner for my family. Or I can just play video games and sleep in. All I did was remove alcohol from the equation. It was worth it. 

Can you remove alcohol from the equation? What do you do on the weekends now that you don’t drink anymore? Do you relapse on the weekend more often than not?",1cohq2v

stopdrinking,Rock bottom,"This may be a long post but this situation has been turning my soul apart. Two days ago after a good 4 day sobriety I stupidly decided that I wanted to drink. I finished an entire bottle of margarita and then I had two cans of voodoo ranger, I must have blacked out because I don’t remember going into my bed. When I woke up my girlfriend was packing her stuff, she said that I had pinned her to the wall while drunk and I was having a psychotic mental breakdown. 

Long story short, she left and got both of our families involved, which she has every right to do, i don’t deserve to have her in my life right now. It’s my birthday today and being completely alone in my dark apartment is the absolute lowest I’ve ever been. I know I’m a terrible person and I deserve zero sympathy, I cannot even fathom doing that. I am never going to touch that stuff again even if someone puts a gun to my head. This is the last straw, I cannot believe we drink when it only leads to terrible situations. I don’t expect sympathy because I am truly an awful person when I drink. I know it sounds like complaining but I’m truly stuck and the anxiety is still racing. I haven’t slept and I haven’t contacted her out of our families making a no contact rule.

I will not drink with you today. I feel like the worst person in the world and I probably am. ",1coya89

Last night a family member died of alcohol related organ failure - not someone I was very close to but still a shock and I feel so awful for his parents and children. I've come into work today and possibly cocked something up, fixed it as best I can but I might still get in trouble. I've got a week off next week and I can feel the call of the void.

Normally I would just leave work, say fuck it and get completely hammered. Maybe a weird question, but how else do you say fuck it without alcohol?",1coqm3b
stopdrinking,I don't know how I'm ever gonna do this,"Heads up this is gonna be a long one. 

Long time lurker. Posted under a different moniker but nuked my old account due to background check paranoia. 

Very long time drinker, about 20 years give or take. I didn't always love alcohol. Dxm and pot was my main addiction before 21, mainly only drinking as a social lubricant, but when I turned 21 alcohol became too convenient. And cheap. Cheapest drug there is. I wasted my entire 20s drinking, getting into fights, abusing girlfriends, messing with all variety of drugs with alcohol always in the background. I'm halfway through my 30s and since the pandemic the disease has only escalated. I've lost handfuls of jobs, almost all my friends and family, homes. I'm sleeping on the floor of my friend's house. I was homeless 2 years ago, very slowly rebounding from that. In retrospect, alcohol is probably most of the reason that progress has been so slow. 

I've been on the wagon for 5 days now. I quit because I just started the highest paying job of my life Monday and it's backbreaking manual labor, but it's a living. It's a shot at getting my life back. I showed up hungover from drinking 5 tall cans of earthquake (10% abv malt piss) and tried to hang with them and got my ass handed to me. They worked me so hard I thought my heart was gonna explode, as God is my witness I was really fighting for my life on that factory floor. 

I quit for the job first and foremost. All the other reasons are valid, but secondary at the end of the day. You know, like not wanting to die in my 40s, wanting to stay out of jail, trivial stuff like that. 

But now here I am, it's the weekend. I've got a tv to watch, 7 dollars to my name, and very little enrichment in my enclosure. I just worked my ass off 5 third shifts in a row. I'm tired. I'm interested in absolutely nothing but the taste of a cold beer slammin down my gullet. The people I live with are throwing a party. I couldn't think of anything I dread more than interacting with people right now. 

There's also no real quiet enjoyment here. Very loud kids, paper thin walls, no real set quiet hours. I really have to hustle to get the sleep I need. If I book it home from work I can get to sleep at about 830 in the morning and get woke up whenever people start coming home. Then it's all door slams, howling huskies, stomping wooden floors, a screeching 5 year old. I can't even imagine what it's gonna be like in 2 weeks when they're not in school. I hate it here, but the rent's crazy cheap and with my new source of income presents a golden opportunity to rebuild, but only if I can stay sane and sober. 

I don't resent anybody in the house, we're all good friends. In fact another reason I'm quitting is to not let them down. My roommates dad basically drank himself to death, and I know my drinking bothers him because he knows I'm an alcoholic. 

There's an AA clubhouse around the corner. I'm getting up and going in an hour, mainly because free coffee sounds really nice right now. Idk what else to do. The urge to drink is all consuming, so all I know to do is leave my wallet at home and get my ass to a meeting. 

So I guess that's the jist of it. I want so badly to keep this sobriety. The ups, even now, still outweigh the downs but sweet mother of fuck the amount of stressors and triggers to drink in my life rn are completely overwhelming. I don't know how I'm ever gonna do this, just that I have to.

My brother started saying some really hurtful things/insulting me out of nowhere. We joke around we each other a lot, and I can definitely take jokes especially because I have brothers, but what he was saying weren’t even jokes, just pure insults and wouldn’t stop. So I was just sitting there quietly and not saying anything while he was insulting me/making fun of me for how I’ve had mental health issues like depression, isolating myself, and the problems that I’ve had with alcohol. Basically telling me that I’m a piece of shit bc of that in different ways and saying it over and over again until I finally just burst into tears.

I’ve been so proud of myself because of how well I’ve been doing. He apologized a little while after so obviously he felt bad, but I still can’t stop crying as I’m typing this.

 I’ve had a battle with getting sober for a few years now. I was a daily 12 pack, 16oz high life drinker. If I didn’t finish it all that night, I’d get another case the next and get a little more shitfaced to compensate for the previous night. If I had a terrible hangover the next morning id swear I’d stop but, within 2 days max, I’d be right back in the rhythm. The worst thing about it was not only the sheer amount, but the fact I like to drink and hang out at home, alone. After years of this, my social circle/life is almost non-existent, I don’t talk to my family as much as I’d like, and I have no partner. I feel like I’m numb inside for what I’ve put my body through. 

Friday last week I got fired from work(non-alcohol related) because the work load coming in has gone down enough for them to get rid of a couple people who have less tenure compared to the rest(I was there for 3 years). When I got home I didn’t even feel like I was living in real life. To add insult to injury, my landlord is getting rid of my house in a couple months and because I spend a lot of my surplus on booz, I have no savings to move. 

My last drink was last Friday night. It has been an incredibly tough week. Everytime I pass the gas station, I still find myself instinctively putting my indicator on to pull in. I’m sick of living in this fog and solitude. I hope this is the start of something new, and in turn, hope I can recover from the mental stress alcohol has put on me and my life.

People approached me afterwards and asked my advice.  Strangely, I felt comfortable to give it and I tried to give them the most useful advice I could.

I was the guy who was drunk at every meeting that no one would approach, except rarely because I was a trainwreck and usually passed out at the table.  Now, I was the only guy with over a year and people looked to me as the experienced and successful one.

stopdrinking,I am trying to learn how to celebrate small victories.,"I just had a personal win, and it made me very sad.

Today my partner needed to take our second vehicle in the mechanic, and the easiest way to do that was to take both vehicles in to the shop so that he would be able to come home after dropping it off. So I drove the car there and back.

Easy, right? But I haven't driven in three years. I was a daily drinker and my blood alcohol level was likely never very good at any given time. I told myself that I had no business operating a vehicle ever, so I simply gave up driving as soon as the daily drinking started. Nothing bad happened, 
but I became absolutely convinced that I could not drive. I just couldn't trust myself to be safe anymore, which resulted in a full blown driving anxiety. Even after I spent some time sober, I still didn't trust myself to drive.

So this should be good! I want to be able to celebrate my little wins and feel good about myself. But it didn't feel good at all. It reminded me of all the poor choices that I made that brought me to the point where being able to drive seems like a huge deal. My partner is so proud of me, and was almost in disbelief when I agreed to do it. That makes me a little bit sad too, because I realize how often he hasn't been able to rely on me for help.

Anyhow, has anyone else ever suffered from a serious case of Stinking Thinking? I would really appreciate hearing some stories about developing a more positive outlook or a healthier sense of self esteem.

Today, for some reason, I truly heard Between the Bars for the first time. What I kind of always thought was a melancholy love song turned out to be the most incredible interpretation of the voice of alcohol addiction speaking to its victim (at least this is how it comes to life for me). An incredibly emotional and powerful peice shining a bit of light into the darkness that was my addiction. Listening to the song in this new way today made me feel a couple things. First, sad that Elliot ultimately succumbed to his demons, like so many others. But also, grateful for this little artifact that reminds me of all the dark sadness from which I’ve escaped. Grateful to be on the other side of that malevolent voice. IWNDWYT

Waiting to finally be caught
Drink up one more time, and I'll make you mine
Keep you apart, deep in my heart

stopdrinking,It’s not that I don’t drink. It’s that I AM sober,"Humans are weird, but you already know that, I’m sure.

Here are some thoughts I have about one way we’re weird. 

Our minds respond differently to negative vs positive ideas. By “negative” and “positive” I don’t mean “sad” or “happy”, I mean ideas expressed with the word “not” as opposed to those without. 

“Not drinking“ is negative. “Being sober” is positive.

“Not drinking” is removing something from life. It leaves a hole. An emptiness. 

“Being sober” adds something to life. A fullness. To become sober is to become something more than we were before.

“Not drinking” is passive. Just sitting there staring at the wall qualifies. 

“Being sober” is active. It’s something we do. It’s embedded in our decisions, our actions, and our responses to the things that happen to us. 

From the outside it might be hard to see the difference between these two ideas, but from within the difference is stark and immense.

So in my best days - days when I feel I’m at the wheel of life - I chose to BE  SOBER instead of being non-drinker. 

But on those other days, I’ll take being a non-drinker. It’s certainly better than who I used to be. ",1coq53e
stopdrinking,"""I love it when it's the quiet one who's the coolest person at the party.""","Is this not the compliment that many of us have been waiting to hear? My first reaction was to hate being perceived as ""the"" quiet person. I have spent my life thinking that quiet people have less to say, because when I feel like an outsider I *do* have less to say, and I don't feel cool about it. I feel defensive about people slapping labels on me based on what aspects of my personality *they* draw out of me. So I drank to assert myself and make a case for my own coolness and now realize that the last time I was called ""quiet"" was in high school (I am now almost 30). 

Instead of just taking this compliment at face value, I've been thinking about what it means to me all week! This might be my sign to revise my beliefs about being perceived as quiet and hold my well-earned confidence close to my chest. I want to let this compliment be the last piece of permission I needed to relax a little more. I also am thinking about how people particularly value and remember the surprising attributes of others that they discovered or were able to draw out. 

It's an important part of my healing journey to discover and revise beliefs that held me down or stressed me out. I'm still discovering them. It's been a long while since I posted here, but today and everyday, IWNDWYT. I've almost hit a year, folks! Thank you. ",1coogav

stopdrinking,First sober birthday 🎂 ,"Hello SD community,

I turned 38 today, and it’s my first birthday sober in more than two decades. As many of you are aware, embracing sobriety brings changes, including in our social circles. My life used to revolve around alcohol: where to consume it, when, and how. But now, the social landscape that once centered around alcohol feels like a void with sobriety.

I've decided to embrace this change and plan a solo birthday celebration. I treated myself to a massage, bought some mini fancy cakes, got a piece of pottery I’ve been eyeing for a while, and I’ll be in bed before 10 pm. Surprisingly, it’s less bittersweet than I expected. I’m grateful to be clear-headed and at peace.

stopdrinking,I'm not drinking tonight,"I've been drinking pretty heavily for the past 3 years or so, but I finally had enough today. After having some dinner, I walked toward the liquor store trying to get wasted again almost habitually, but this time I decided to buy a pack of cigarettes from a different store instead, which was undeniably one of the best decisions I made in a while.

As I'm smoking a cigarette right now, I can just feel the urge to drink, as well as the anxiousness and hand tremors from not drinking on time began to ease. While I understand smoking isn't ideal for my health but for now my priority is to come clean at all costs, and having some cigarettes is the best solution I have at hand to help calm me down and get me through the first night of sobriety which is the roughest for many.

stopdrinking,My rock bottom is right now,"Throwaway. Long post but such is life.

I’m 22F. I didn’t pick up drinking till I was 21 and serving in a bar. This job provided me with “friends” and feeling of camaraderie that comes with being intoxicated and going to bars after work at 4am. As someone who was always socially anxious and had no friends, the feeling was literally euphoric. After 6 months I quickly overdid it and started reaching the point where I needed two 120 proof shots immediately upon waking up, otherwise I would start having withdrawals and an unshakeable feeling of dread.

Eventually I ended up reeling it back and threw away all my alcohol at home and was able to curb at least the physical dependency. But this year I quit my job and lost all of my friends due to, funnily enough, something I did while drinking. However my boyfriend (who calls himself a borderline alcoholic, but is really only a binge drinker) has been my biggest supporter and the light of my life in this time. I truly see a future with him and he means so much to me.

Obviously, the emotional stress of this situation caused me to start drinking at home again, and it’s become dire. I start drinking immediately upon waking up and I look forward to my first shot of the day — it truly calms me down. I can’t go anywhere unless I know I can access alcohol or else I start to panic. I am now working a job where I am bartending, and have no restraint to stop myself from getting drunk. Yesterday I was so drunk that I couldn’t even close the bar and I had to ask my manager for help because I couldn’t do basic math. My coworkers and I went to the club afterwards, and long story short I woke up with my coworker in my bed. I have no recollection of anything after the club and I kicked him out immediately. I am horrified. I known non-addicts will say that alcohol won’t cause you to do anything you wouldn’t do sober, but it’s frankly not true. I would never, ever do this, and I want to puke just thinking of even sleeping with this person.

I have a propensity to blackout when going to bars, and I have obviously had sex while drunk. Boyfriends have had sex with me many, many times where I was so drunk that I was unconscious and asleep. I have had to stop sex to throw up in the middle of it. These things make me feel disgusting and violated, but I understand that this was not intended assault. It was a consequence of my addiction. In this same way, I feel violated and horrified by what happened, but I know now that this is the power that alcohol holds and I need to get sober.

When my boyfriend and I started dating, he got so drunk that he shit in my tub and smeared feces all over my bathroom. When he woke up he had no recollection and was horrified. This is my shitting in the tub moment. But the scariest part of it all is the thought of putting down the bottle. I can’t leave my job for financial reasons and the thought of having to be surrounded by alcohol all day — I don’t know if I can stay sober. It’s horrible, but the thought of sobriety makes me feel suicidal. I feel like if I can’t have alcohol I would rather just kill myself. I am lost and miserable. I don’t know where to start, but I’m starting by not drinking today. For today, I am going to an AA meeting.",1cp0hlk
stopdrinking,Day 1…again," I’ve been binge drinking for almost a year now. Every time I try to stop, I fall off the wagon not even a mile down the road. I think the longest stretch of time I went without alcohol was 6 days. 

But I’m done. I’m done waking up exhausted, with my memories of the night before blurring together with my dreams. I feel so depersonalized, as if I’m just sleepwalking all the time. It’s making my anxiety so much worse. 

I’m hoping that joining this community will help in finally taking control of my addiction instead of allowing it to run and ruin my life.

**KEY NOTES if you don't wanna read it all.**

**--------------------**

&#x200B;

**It’s all about having** ***a healthy calorie deficit applicable to your activity*** **if you want to lose weight.**

SCALES ARE NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL OF WEIGHT LOSS!

**Work out your TDEE for your calories and be realistic about your activity. Less than 10km distance walked/traveled/moved around each day is a sedentary lifestyle. Keep that in mind when saying how much you workout if you do.**

SCALES ARE NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL OF WEIGHT LOSS!

**The times of day/night you eat doesn’t matter.**

SCALES ARE NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL OF WEIGHT LOSS!

**Taking body measurements and a photo journal is a must. Have one photo in just underwear and one in with an outfit on. Sometimes your critical eye will not see what actually changed where the outfit will.**

SCALES ARE NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL OF WEIGHT LOSS!

**You don't have to exercise to lose weight but it helps a hell of a lot.**

SCALES ARE NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL OF WEIGHT LOSS!

**Just move! Whatever exercise that you will do regularly is good exercise. But be aware doing yoga everyday won't burn the same as a CrossFit class.**

SCALES ARE NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL OF WEIGHT LOSS!

**This process takes a long time and if you are not consistent in you efforts then don't expect a change**.

SCALES ARE NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL OF WEIGHT LOSS! **They measure you gravity to the ground. That's it. There are other factors of changing body composition that are far more important and a end goal weight isn't a bad thing but shouldn't be gospel to how well you have done so far.**

&#x200B;

Now to the long winded stuff!

**--------------------**

**CALORIES**

**--------------------**

To lose weight it is a very simple principle of energy expenditure. You must expend more than you consume and that's it, a simple calorie deficit. Do that correctly and you will lose weight. Even if you suffer with something like PCOS it will work. Sometimes I noticed with clients is that it worked but was slower but it wasn't an excuse for it not to work.

&#x200B;

For an adult I recommend 250-500 calorie deficit of your maintenance calories. for 12-16 year olds I recommend no more than 150-200 calories as they are still growing so a small deficit is better for them and increasing a kids physical activity can a lot of the time be all that's needed for children with no deficit added at all.

A slow weight  loss is usually a sign of good weight loss where good habits are being  ingrained into your life and you have a healthy calorie deficit so for the average person going over 500 calorie deficit is pretty pointless and usually not sustainable with the exception of a doctor's recommendation or you are a bodybuilder.

Now if you are morbidly obese you may likely need to do a bigger deficit than 500 calories  of what you normally eat but I would advise you to calculate your calories for maintenance then compare it to the calories to what you have been eating so far and bring it down to maintenance calories first for 2-4 weeks as you adapt to a healthier level of calories before adding a deficit as well. Typically most people I helped were eating to excess of 2000 calories plus of what they should've been eating just to maintain their current weight.

&#x200B;

**--------------------**

**Calculating Calories**

**--------------------**

[https://tdeecalculator.net](https://tdeecalculator.net/) is my recommended calculator for this. Its not perfect but as calculators go it does the job reliably enough to be the one I recommend.

Your  Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is an estimation of how many  calories you burn per day with exercise is taken into account. It is  calculated by first figuring out your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR which is  basically the calories your body requires to function healthily), then  multiplying that value by an activity multiplier.

Since  your BMR represents how many calories your body burns when at rest, it  is necessary to adjust the numbers upwards to account for the calories  you burn during the day. This is true even for those with a sedentary  lifestyle.

&#x200B;

Don’t freak out that they are higher than what you expect, remember slow steady weight loss is best.

&#x200B;

When choosing your activity levels, my personal belief (and how I was taught) is that if you don't travel 10km a day (i.e. you have covered 10km with your feet walking in some format that isn't exercise) then your general activity is sedentary. So if you don't cover that distance drop your activity by one level as you may workout 6 times a week (heavy exercise) but if you sit on your butt all day in an office job then a moderate exercise choice is probably wiser.

&#x200B;

With any calculation the more info you put in it, the more accurate it will be. So with that in mind if you are able to put your body fat percentage in, the calorie suggestion will be more accurate for you.

For preferred methods of measuring body fat, I like the 9 point caliper test but you do need someone that knows how to do it or it will not be very accurate and even then if they do know how to it  properly there is a +/-3% variable even still. I do not recommend bio-electrical impedance as it can vary widely depending on your body shape (think pear shaped people) and your hydration. I take my Fitbit aria with a massive pinch of salt and wait every 4 weeks when I can see my mate that knows how to do the 9 point test.

I wouldn't worry too much on figuring your body fat percentage out though as how your general body composition is as you go along is more important and whether it is changing for the better.

For kids (12-16yrs) don't worry about measuring it at all unless a doctor has requested to be aware of it specifically.

&#x200B;

**If you use a calculator to workout your TDEE then do not follow your fitness tracker.**

TDEE takes your daily life and exercise you do into equation so you don't have add ""exercise calories"" to your allowance as that has been done already, so keep to your TDEE not your trackers.

&#x200B;

**Also be aware that as you lose weight you will need to re-check your TDEE.**

If you lose 2-3kg that can be enough to need to re-work your TDEE so do be aware of that if your weight loss slows or plateaus.

&#x200B;

**--------------------**

**How to track what you eat?**

**--------------------**

These days the main two apps/websites are MyFitnessPal & Loseit. Both are good and regularly corrected and updated. I personally use MyFitnessspal myself.

It's quite simple log in what you eat (preferably at the time of eating so you remember it properly or when you food prep it) and I mean **everything** including that biscuit one of your work colleges offered you in passing.

&#x200B;

Also be aware of logging liquid calories as well. If you drink a lot of smoothies, cordial, fruit juices, soda or coffee. Milk and sugar are still calories (especially if you like lattes) so make sure these logged in as well as so many times you ""eat well"" but all those liquids are ruining your progress.

I have genuinely had past clients change nothing to their food apart from drop all drinks apart from water and lose 2-4 kg in a month so please look at everything that goes in you.

&#x200B;

In conjunction of using one of the apps you will need a good set of scales (preferably digital in my opinion) as if you don't accurately put in what you eat, then there is a high chance of you over eating and not being in a proper deficit. If you don't accurately log what you eat then you can't ever say you are being accurate with your diet. Studies have shown time and time again we as people underestimate what we eat greatly.

&#x200B;

I would not trust portion sizes of packaging that well as 99.9% of the time they don't match what has been put in the packet for example a plain wrap could say 62g a wrap (187 calories) on the packaging  but end up being a 72g serving so be 224 calories. Not a lot of difference (35 calories) but it can build up over multiple meals easily. 3 meals over a day x 35 =105 calories and that can be the difference of real changes especially of your planned deficit is only 250 calories.

&#x200B;

There are some communities that say that tracking food causes eating disorders but the realistic truth is that if you don't keep track of what you eat in some way with reasonable accuracy, the chances are you will overeat and not lose weight. That is not the fault of diet culture or anything like that, it is your responsibility.

&#x200B;

Once you have a pretty sensible diet that is working for you and gotten used to it and know it inside and out then you can start to eyeball your portions as no one wants to be stuck to a scale each time they cook forever **but** I recommend doing this with high volume low calorie foods or if you have an object that you use and will know within a reasonable amount of accuracy it will be that amount.

I have a tiny measuring jug that i can do portions of rice or pasta and I know what level is going to be right +/- 5g uncooked but I also admittedly allow for that inaccuracy in my diet and have an assumption any eyeballing is always the overestimate to cover myself and stop any disappointments.

&#x200B;

**--------------------**

**Diet**

**--------------------**

&#x200B;

**I can't iterate enough that the one that you can sustain is the best diet!**

&#x200B;

It honestly doesn't matter if you follow slimmers world, keto, intermittent fasting (I kinda do this one) or anything thing else as like I said before if you are in a deficit you will lose weight.

A healthy balanced diet is preferable but not wholly necessary when it comes to losing weight but again recommended.

Personally  I think the best thing for your food is once you have your calories  worked out is to use a macro break. That’s the breakdown of how much  protein, fats and carbs you eat (apps can track that for you). If adding this seems overly complicated and feel too much then don't bother with it but I do think it is a good idea to do especially if trying to some form of exercise to 'tone' your physique.

I  would go for a 40% Protein, 40% Fats and 20% Carbs as a break. Protein  and fats help you feel fuller for longer and generally more satisfied  when eaten. Protein also helps keep your muscle mass while losing  weight (that is a bit bro science but also kinda true) especially if exercising regularly.

I  for the most part make sure I eat my quota of protein and don’t worry  too much about the break of fats and carbs as long as I hit my calorie  goal. Admittedly though I always  feel the most satisfied when I keep to the macro break stated.

I used to fast 19-20 hours a day and re-feed over 5-4 hours but with my girlfriend and her little one that doesn't really work well and though quite often I don't eat what they eat (they're vegetarian and I was told to never be one but that's another story) I like to be able to sit, eat and chat with them at the dinner table instead of sit there like a pleb or away on the sofa. so typically now I'll have a small lunch, biggish evening meal and snack a little while after. It a rough version of intermittent fasting but it works for me.

A dietitian I met had a cool chat with me and he said to add this to my guide to clear some things up and

“I could tell you to eat this or that and don’t eat this or that which, is kinda my job to do. But at the end of the day all I do is make a food plan that puts them on a calorie plan to lose weight, maintain weight or gain weight depending on what you medically need (deals with a lot of NHS work).

In a perfect world I’d tell you to never eat bacon as it’s pretty bad for you but it’s f\*\*king delicious and so I know you’re gonna eat it too like me but if you eat 2 slices of it a week, it won’t kill you. A little of everything is fine and excess of anything is bad. Stop over complicating it, eat meat, veggies, fruit, nuts, fat, carbs, protein and junk. Just not a lot of one thing. Oh and stay hydrated, so many times people moan about being hungry all the dam time and they’re just dehydrated.”

&#x200B;

**SCALES AND WEIGHT LOSS MEASUREMENT**

**--------------------**

&#x200B;

**SCALES ARE NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL OF WEIGHT LOSS!**

&#x200B;

They really aren't, they are a good guide to **help show** a downward trend but do not dictate your successes or failures of you and how well you are doing.

Scales are the equipment that measures your relation to the earth's gravity that forever make us cry ourselves to sleep. Use them with a pinch of salt please I beg you.

Don’t aim to lose a  certain amount each week. Just aim to lose and accept it’s not a temporary measure it’s a lifestyle change and going to take a long time.  Accept that, plan for the long term and screw beach body ready crap.

&#x200B;

Along with scales I recommend taking a photo in just your underwear and also a photo in one particular outfit as well as taking body measurements with a tape measure.

[This youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9ZnioXCRhU) is old and cheesy but explains how to use a tape measure pretty well but ignore the calipers section as that's pretty naff.

&#x200B;

With how regular you take measurements, I would recommend going on the scales and taking a photo of yourself in your underwear once a week at the same time of day and the same day each week as if you stand on the scales repeatedly throughout day you will find your weight fluctuates so much in 24 hours.

&#x200B;

As for taking measurements with a tape measure and photo with your selected outfit I would recommend taking them every 2-4 weeks but try to always keep the intervals the same for consistency.

Ladies  your natural cycle can affect your weight greatly (you probably already  know this) so try not to forget it if the scales mess you around a bit.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/cm8hlt/one\_for\_the\_ladies\_who\_i\_see\_posting\_about\_lack/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/cm8hlt/one_for_the_ladies_who_i_see_posting_about_lack/)

Explains this better than a male like me so I will leave the ladies to read up on another trainer I respect.

&#x200B;

**--------------------**

**SPEED OF WEIGHT LOSS**

**--------------------**

It is unfortunate but the truth is weight loss is not fast at the best of times and plateaus are often so strap in for a long haul. Some weeks will be 1kg loss, some 0.5kg and sometimes even a 100g (which will barely register on most scales) but you have to remember it is still a downward trend no matter how small.

If things are plateauing don't freak out, breathe and look at what you have been doing during the plateau.

1. Look at your past measurements and photos and see how you have changed (especially from the beginning).
2. Look at how well you have been eating or how accurately you have been tracking what you have been eating as a common issue is your eyeballing skills have been off on regular foods you have been eating.
3. Has your physical activity dropped as of late? Life and work can get in the way sometimes and you need to re-evaluate your TDEE temporally while your activity is lower.
4. Or the one good cause for a plateau is that since you have lost weight and your TDEE has dropped because of this. This can be the most common reason as when you lose weight (2-3kg) your TDEE will drop and it's normal. Weight loss is a fluid thing and so are your calories, be aware and adapt as necessary.

&#x200B;

**--------------------**

**Exercise**

**--------------------**

To be honest do what exercise **you enjoy and will do regularly.** This is the most important thing about exercise as if you don't enjoy it 90% of the time, then you won't keep it up. It's as simple as that. Just be aware that yoga won't burn as much as a crossfit class.

&#x200B;

Now if you are stuck for ideas of what to do, here are some simple circuits you can do that don't require a lot of space. I would advise making sure you are warmed up before you do any exercise.

I recommend doing [this](https://darebee.com/workouts/quick-warmup-workout.html) followed by [this one](https://darebee.com/workouts/4-minute-warmup-workout.html) as they are quick, easy and get the job done (I recommend darebee for workout ideas in general if you're ever stuck for what to do).

The following 4 workouts are pretty simple and follow the same format:

Try to do 10 circuits with 1-2 mins rest between circuits. It doesn't matter if you can only do a couple of circuits at the start just do what you can do.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

With any exercise please look each up properly and make sure you know how to do it properly. Don't be afraid to make an exercise easier (or harder) if need be.

&#x200B;

After any workout you should make sure you cool down and stretch properly [this should be enough](https://darebee.com/workouts/top-to-bottom-workout.html) to cover most muscle groups.

&#x200B;

**--------------------**

**Supplements?**

**--------------------**

Long story short, you don't need them. Some protein powder to help you get the protein quota and a good multi vit but keep it to that.

&#x200B;

Fat burners, fat metabolizors, fat removers are all crap. If it says it will help you burn fat, chances are it will be a waste of your money and you will be better off spending it elsewhere.

&#x200B;

When it comes to supplements I don't have much more to say on it to be honest. I don't think there is a need to go much more into them than that. Unless you are training for something specific don't bother to look into them unless you have a trainer that you use personally to advise you otherwise or ask some of the nutrition or supplement reddits here for more info.

WeightLossAdvice,"Sub 2,000 calorie cheat day consistently sets me back a mathematically impossible amount","30 year old male. 5'10, 180lb, 20% bodyfat (DEXA), 1850 RMR (tested). I'll start by saying I typically know how to lose weight, as I dropped from 230lb to 180lb in a year with meal prep and a calorie deficit.

But I have now been 180lb since October 2023. My diet consists of meal prepped chicken/rice (1300 calories/day) followed by the same Chick Fil A cheat meal on saturdays (1850 calories/day). I only eat OMAD, and I have not consumed more than 2600 calories in a day in 7 months.

I thought my plateau was due to my fitness, so in February I started running. I can now run nearly a half marathon without stopping. I run for about an hour 7 days a week, and I still only consume 1300 calories/day from meal prep, except I now burn about 700 of those calories on top of what is supposed to be my RMR. I have so few calories that recovery is impossible, but I ignore the pain and push every single day.

Yet here I am at 180 still. I am NOT gaining muscle, proven by DEXA scans. I get as low as 175 during the week, and hit 180 again every weekend on my ""cheat meal"" that is still under my maintenance calories.

WeightLossAdvice,Why did you gain weight again after successfully losing weight?,"I lost 10 kg, it was the first time in my life, my cheeks were gone, I looked... well, it could have been better, but not bad. And I continued, a little more and I will become Apollo! But...I got a cold, I didn’t go to the gym for a couple of weeks and I didn’t even notice how I just started eating a lot again in those couple of weeks, it happened somehow completely unnoticed by me. 

And my brain thinks, “Well, if you’ve already started eating again, does that mean I don’t care anymore? Can I just eliminate thoughts of losing weight from your head?” and that's the end, I think I've gained all the kilos back again. No serious illnesses, no hormonal imbalances, thoughts about healthy eating just disappeared from my head",1com2fk

I’ve thought of some main problems like my coffee being way too sugary, needing a lot more protein since I work out a lot, portion control, too much snacking, lack of quick meal ideas or options, not wanting to spend too much money etc.

WeightLossAdvice,So…what do you do about clothes? ,"My friend is getting married in about two weeks and I’m having a hard time figuring out what to wear. I’ve lost about 85 pounds in the past year, the bulk of which has been within the last 6 months. The dresses I bought as options earlier this year fit much differently. I’ve been trying to avoid buying new clothes until I reach my goal (I have at least 30 more pounds to lose), but I’d also like to wear something that makes me feel confident and not like a melted candle. 🤣

So here’s my question—when in your weight loss journey did you decide to invest in new clothes? Should I look into altering what I already have? 

How do you get over the paralyzing fear of trying smaller sizes? How do you make this fun? 

[Not sure if this is allowed, but here are pictures of the dresses I bought earlier](https://imgur.com/a/rQ1EsZ9)—the left is when it was purchased and the right is what they look like now. It’s a summer wedding that’s slightly more casual, but still dressed up. Not a gala or anything like that. 😂

WeightLossAdvice,I gained 1.2lbs and I am very upset,"So I have been doing intermittent fasting to lose weight for a couple years now. I stick to a 5hr eatting period.  It was really great to start healthy eatting habits. And really kicked into gear this new life style. 

Lately though. I've grown tired of the stomach pains and awful cravings. I felt it was giving me a bad relationship with food as well, since during eatting hours id tend to over eat and cheat meal once a week was extremely hard to not go crazy on. Not to mention, its not always very convenient. Sometimes i am out running errands or just enjoying myself and then i have to rush home to make sure i eat in time. 

 when i would get off fasting for a week or two because of vacation or holidays. Id blow up like a balloon. Gaining 10lbs very quickly. If i was on vacay for 2ish weeks. Then by the end i would start to even out as my eatting would regulate and i wasnt binge eatting anymore. 

I was trying to find a way to get away from fasting. When i heard a rando fitness guy talk about confusing your body with high carb and low carb days. I'm not one for counting carbs. But i do count calories.
So i thought id experiment with fasting every other day. on off days id just have a 500 cal post workout meal. ( a jimmy deans egg white, turkey sausage sandwhich, with baked snap peas, and keto friendly cookie)

I gave it a shot. I work out 5 days a week, weights, cardio, and abs. Then Saturday i play tennis for 2hrs. Sunday is chill out. I was eatting about 1100 calories during work days and off days was probly closer to 1300. I am 5'9"" (F)  and currently 153lbs 

The cravings disappeared, i'm eatting healthier, i stopped binging. I have more energy, i was able to increase the weights on all my workouts, i'm in a better mode, i look great in my swim suit, my clothes are loser and overall so much happier.

The problem is. The first week i tried it, I weighed in, I lost .6lbs. ( with fasting i was loseing about 1lb a week) No big deal. I had a deit change. Its to be expected. At least i didnt gain. 
This week. I gained. 1.2lbs 
I was completely crushed. If i'm gaining. Then i have to go back to fasting full time. Back to binging, back to stomach aches, back to awful cravings. 
I just dont understand how i can be THIS active. Have better eatting habits. And STILL gain. I checked my measurements to be sure. My waist was the same, but i lost half an inch in my hips. 
I am beyond frustrated.

WeightLossAdvice,Found the perfect workout for me : DANCING,"I am so happy!
This morning I already found out that I lost 1 kg in 10 days while I was still learning how to have a balanced diet and what workout I'd like but I also found my favorite activity!
I kinda hate all work outs I tried cause I have no fun but also because of my low tension is I can't keep up even with beginner workout T.T

Yesterday I danced in my bathroom and I started sweating and I thought ""wait this is activity I enjoy, I do not have to make or follow a workout!""
So this morning I danced for 30 minutes on songs I like and reallized I burned 250 kcal (i used a fit watch) !! It's amazing cause while you have fun and excitment you also can dance to your own pace!

So if you guys are looking to an indoor activity that is easy on your knees, and that you can adjust to your pace dancing might be for you!

I’m 175cm and currently weigh 82.5kg. I’ve just been overseas on holiday for a month and have gained 2-3kg. I recently turned 30 and I’m a woman. 

I used to always have a healthy BMI and one point had an underweight BMI. 

My doctor thinks I have PCOS because over the last couple of years, I’ve gained weight and find it difficult to lose. I eat healthily always and regularly go to the gym. An ultrasound I had didn’t show any cysts on my ovaries but my doctor explained that they’re not always visible when it starts developing and that down the track it’s most likely going to show up. 

I did calorie deficit for a while and it kind of helped, not really. I have a Fitbit and usually do 10k - 20k steps a day. 

I’m at a loss and just want to give up. I didn’t go out with friends last night because I had a break down that I couldn’t fit into clothes I’ve always been able to fit into. I’m a size 12 at the moment. 

I’m not really sure what to do. Has anyone experienced/is currently experiencing what I am? Please help :( ",1cp8jg1

WeightLossAdvice,Stuck at weight,"I am a 20 year old struggling with weight loss. Currently at 206 and I just can’t get out of the 200’s with a caloric deficit and rigorous exercise routine daily. I wasn’t always like this, i’ve been way lighter even reaching 150 when I was 15-16. Couple of months ago I was in an ideal state of 180 range but now it just seems impossible to even get under 200. A little background, I’ve been in this “bulk” for some time, so I don’t doubt some if not most of the weight is muscle. I regularly lift with high intensity and sweat an obscene amount, I also swim almost every day around half a mile to a mile and bike 4x that. I track my burnt calories with my Garmin watch and usually end up around 2,800-3,500. My caloric intake can depend on my mood to eat but usually around 2,200-2,500 and i’m at least consuming 150g of protein daily. Now here’s my take on the situation, i’ve lost a little bit of weight maybe 4-5lb the last 2-3 weeks. So I could just feel down about me loosing weight slowly (which sucks). I don’t get enough sleep on a nightly basis maybe around 4-5 hours but I nap for another 3-4 hours after a couple hours after I wake up. I guess I’m not the happiest person and maybe often a little stressed. I also don’t perceive pain and stress like most people do, I’ve become almost numb to the feeling so I don’t even know if I am stressed or not. I also don’t use the toilet often or as much as I think I should. I drink a ton of water and use the sauna. Overall I just want an opinion on this matter it’s super un motivating as it is and I just don’t even care to keep all this muscle and become a cardio bunny.

What exercise etiquette and posturing / hygiene do I need to keep in mind so that I can reach my goals without fucking myself up? Obviously no bending, twisting, or exercises which are loadd-bearing on my back, which sucks and I feel like doesn't leave me with much, but I gotta get out of this slump. I want to regain confidence in my self image, and I believe losing some weight and gaining some muscle will help me get better and keep me from another injury.

Thanks in advance.",1cp2kdm
WeightLossAdvice,HELP Unexpected weight gain.,"Hey everyone, I need some insights on my fitness journey. I used to be 110kg I cut down to 70kg in a span of 2.5 years.

Then I bulked up from 70kg to 88kg (in 8 months) and then started cutting, managing to drop down to 85kg. Wanting to speed up the process, I re-enrolled in MMA classes. 

Previously, this helped me rapidly drop from 80kg to 69kg. I've been on a strict calorie deficit, not even taking protein powder or creatine, just having two meals a day plus a coffee. 

It's been nearly a month of training under a tin shade on the top floor of a building with temperatures around 45°C, including an hour of dedicated cardio. Despite this intense regimen, I've unexpectedly gone up 4 kilos to 89kg. 

However, I'm starting to see my upper abs and noticing my fat pockets shrink. WTF is happening? Am I gaining muscle, or could there be another explanation? 

To deal with the heat I have been taking one sachet of ORS daily. Is that the problem?",1cp1avd

WeightLossAdvice,stubborn belly fat,"I’m a 20 year old male who’s been working out for almost 3 years now.
A bit of context, i was on the fat since i was a child (around 30% bf consistently i would say)
 until i joined the gym in the beginning of June 2021. it took some time to learn everything but i would say that i’ve been consistently training for 2 years now.
Training/lifestyle:  i go to the gym 5 times a week and follow science based training. I am a pretty active person since i live in Paris so i mainly walk to get around the city (8000-10000 steps daily average).
I am a uni student so my lifestyle is pretty sedentary other than the things i mentioned.
Diet: when i started working out, i dropped weight to around 22% bf and been there ever since. i don’t really care about what i eat as long as i hit my daily protein goal. i should add that i have a healthy-ish diet on normal days but i enjoy huge cheat meals every once in a while.
I started tracking my calories and following a strict diet a month ago.
I’m 5’10 (178cm) and currently weigh in at 170 lbs (77kgs) 
I eat about 2000 calories per day which puts me in a big deficit as i would like to get lean before the summer starts.
I’m currently at 18-19% bf, average physique as far as muscle mass goes but i still have an abnormally large belly unless i flex or vaccum.
I was wondering how to approach this problem along with the calorie deficit.
i am not in a hurry but i don’t think the calorie deficit alone is enough to get that flat stomach look/ abs.
i’m sorry if it’s badly written as it is my first reddit post and english is not my first language.

WeightLossAdvice,3 tips to keep you consistent over the weekends:,"1. Plan Your Meals and Activities: Prepare healthy snacks and meals in advance to avoid impulsive eating. Schedule weekend activities like a morning walk, a bike ride, or a fitness class to keep yourself active and distracted from food temptations.

2. Stick to Your Routine: Try to maintain your usual sleep schedule and meal timings. This consistency helps regulate your body's hunger cues and can prevent overeating. If you typically exercise in the morning during the week, continue that pattern on the weekends.

3. Allow for Flexibility: Give yourself a bit of flexibility to enjoy a special meal or treat, but do it mindfully. Decide in advance what you’ll indulge in, enjoy it without guilt, and balance it out with healthier choices throughout the rest of the day.

Have a great weekend, and stay accountable.",1colytn

loseit,What's your strange weightloss hobby?,"Mine is watching eating challenges on YouTube while I'm working out on my stationary bike. For some reason they don't trigger me at all and I just love watching people cram 25,000 calories worth of fast food, cookies, pasta, pizza, etc into their mouths. EriktheElectric is my favorite. I think, in an odd way, watching this stuff sort of scratches the itch for me of wanting/needing to eat junk myself. I see these people eating so much crap that they feel physically ill and I'm like, ""I'm good with a salad, thanks!"" 

Anyone else have a strange weightloss habit?

loseit,"For shorter women, we are taught to ignore our hunger cues","It's well-talked about how it's harder for shorter women to lose weight, as we have lower caloric requirements, but I was also thinking how societal expectations make it much harder to follow lower caloric requirements in general.

For example, as a 5'2 woman, my maintenance calories are around 1600 if I'm sedentary. Let's say I decide to go out for pizza with four friends, and we split a large, 8-slice pizza. A slice is 350 calories. How do we split the pizza? Typically, when eating out, we split the pizza equally, with two slices per person, despite the fact that not everyone has the same caloric requirements. Now, I'm in a situation where eating the two slices is ""expected"", but also almost half of my daily caloric needs, whereas for a taller, athletic friend, two slices may only account for a fourth of his daily caloric needs. 

Because we are all served the same large portion sizes, it skews our idea on how much food we actually need. There's pressure to ignore our hunger cues to ""keep up"" with people who require much more calories. 

I also see this play out in the office when a coworker offers treats. Typically, I'm offered a whole donut, not a half, despite the fact that a whole donut is a large portion of my daily caloric needs for a quick sweet treat. When ordering fast food, I'm still encouraged to buy the value meal with a burger, fries, and large drink. 

I'm still planning out a breakfast, lunch, and dinner because that's what I was taught is an appropriate eating pattern, even if I'm not too hungry for lunch and really just need a snack. At gatherings, I'm encouraged to fill my whole plate with food, even if I'm not actually hungry anymore. When my daily caloric intake needs are less than 2000 a day, this really adds up, but there's something awkward about explaining this to people who are just trying to be generous. I don't want to be rude, so I fill up my plate.

Over time, this teaches us that we should be able to eat more food than we really need, because all of our friends, family, and coworkers can eat more. We learn to ignore our hunger cues to stop eating when actually full. 

Anyways, just a thought I had. Not I gotta stop procrastinating.",1couiri
loseit,Confessions of a an X-Deluded Dieter.,"The more weight I lose, the more I tattle on ""old me"".  Im coming to realize, I was a big fat liar liar pants on fire- to myself.  I would tell myself bald faced lies, did I know it wasn't right?  That I was feeding myself these lies & false information?  Yea I think subconsciously, yes.  

I can almost giggle about it now, but im sort of bummed because im missing information I would really benefit from now.  

Something i've been whining about is how ive lost 75+ pounds & am still wearing the same sizes.  I buy most of my clothes online & I would measure my body with the sewing tape thing & then I would scribble the numbers on my dressing mirror in eyeliner or lipstick.  I've got years of measurements written on that mirror.  

The heartbreaking thing...those measurements never changed.  But standing in front of the mirror today, wondering where the weight is coming off from...I realized the tape was pretty loose.  I pulled on it a bit more...realized I always used to do that, & quite forcefully.  Realized my starting measurements are trash.  I have no idea what my waist size was at 350 pounds.  But now at 273 ive supposedly lost only 2 inches.  My starting measurements were absolutely a lie.  

It got me thinking about all the ways I used to lie to myself.  That one being the most apparent & tangible.  

When I got serious about counting calories & using a food scale.  I remember opening a container of cottage cheese, taking a giant bite with the big spoon (which now I realize was probably a 1/4 of a cup bite) but back then it was like, ""That never happened, I weight & measure all my food""- lie.  

Or the granola bars I used to run off to bed with, - ""Never happened, I don't eat after dinner""....lie.  

Or when I logged my walks & the choices were ""light paced"", ""medium paced"", ""fast paced"", I always picked fast... lie.

I always rounded up exercise times, a 15 minute walked would be logged as a 30 minute walk or a walk around the block would be logged as a 1 mile walk...lie.  

Id fill a pint mason jar with ice to make a cocktail & pour alcohol in the bottom couple inches, realistically a minimum of 2 shots, perhaps 3 shots. I would log that as a 1 oz shot...lie.  

I would never eat more than 1 serving size of chips, even if the whole bag disappeared lol, God only knows how many tortilla chips were actually consumed, just 14 chips i'd say...lie.

Big Cup Reese's, that was just a regular little cup...lie.

Weekends didn't exist at all those were just blank days...lie.

Just sooo many things.  Im a lot more honest with myself now.  

Its one thing to just be lax about your methods, or just have free days now & again...but I was actively deceiving myself.  Completely deluded.  For years.      

If anyone else would like to confess their previous lies, i'd love to read'em...Lets have a chuckle together & smile about how far we have come since then.

loseit,How can I recover mentally from being a victim of feederism?,"To make a very long story short, I was a victim of feederism for almost 4 years. For those who don’t know what feederism is, it’s a kink/fetish wherein one person (the feeder) gets sexual gratification from over feeding their partner (the feedee) and watching them get fatter. In extreme cases, the feeder wants to essentially feed their partner to death (a sub-fetish called death-feederism.

I won’t go into much detail but I was essentially Stockholm-syndromed into the fetish. I began doing it to please my partner, but then I started making money from posting feeder content online. I’ve since deleted all my NSFW accounts and have been trying to lose the weight I gained, but I believe I have some sort of trauma from the whole experience. Every time I look at food or think about eating, I feel physically ill. I am overwhelmed with self hatred all the time. I hate my body and what I’ve done to myself, and what I’ve allowed to be done to me. 

If anyone has any advice, please please let me know. I’m so tired of feeling this way. I just want to go back to the happy, naive person I used to be.",1cona7f
loseit,"I don't know who needs to hear this, but the best time to start is NOW, even if you start slowly. ","I assume in this sub a lot of us probably struggle with motivation. With weight loss and getting healthy, if you've had whatever bad habits for a long time, it's mentally very exhausting trying to break out of them. I for example tend to eat poorly/too much to deal with certain emotions. I know I shouldn't, but I do. The issue is I'm really good at making a diet *plan*...then I barely stick to it, and I have my cute little excel sheet that I made with a start and finish date, and I keep immediately cheating, so I just repeatedly push the dates back. The old ""my diet starts tomorrow"".

I heard recently about something called ""last supper syndrome"", and that's essentially this. When you plan to diet/eat healthier in the future, if that's the near future, you'll use those few days before to really indulge. But what if you procrastinate and those few days turn into a few weeks? Then it's really easy to spiral and give up because your ""last meal of freedom"" has suddenly happened 30 times. 

Recognize the cycle and stop it now. Even if a calorie deficit is intimidating, maybe try easing into it. If you've been *gaining* weight, maybe take a week to eat at your maintenance before going into a deficit. 

Hope that helps!

loseit,I was laughed at for being fat,"I'm in my 40s and have returned to college to retrain for a better career because I had an accident years ago. While being at home recovering for that period I've become obese weighing 220 pounds! I've never been this big as I previously weighed 140 pounds (5""7 height).

So yesterday I went into college for class and this group of teens laughed as I walked by! It's not the first time either. Yes I'm very oddly shaped now as I already had big boobs but now they're humongous! Bra size 48H! So I have huge boobs & huge stomach but my legs aren't big!

So anyway the laughing at me has caused me to take my weight loss seriously! I'm limited in what I can do as the accident also left me with chronic, joint and muscle pains, also fibromyalgia. I'll start with changing my dietary intake as I do eat quite a bit of junk food but I also love fruits too. I already have a rowing machine, treadmill, stepper & mini trampoline/rebounder as I was always into my fitness & heath before the accident. I'm so happy I don't have go to a gym to exercise as I see too many people online posting their workout with other people in the background (not even blurring their faces out) and also fat shaming people who are obviously in the gym to become healthier.

loseit,"Half is most certainly enough. Or, how I maintained my diet while eating out with friends.","Last night, I was invited out to an impromptu dinner by my roommate and a friend who happened to be visiting. Instead of rejecting the invite, I opted to go along, because I hadn't seen the friend in months, and I had the calories to spare.

Once we were at the chosen restaurant, all looking at our menus, I got stuck deliberating between an order of chicken wings and a chicken salad. Not knowing how many chicken wings were in the former (seriously, who forgets to list how many wings are included in a wing basket?) or how many calories would be in the sauce, I opted to go for the salad, as I figured that would be a lot easier to guestimate.

The salad in question was offered in either a ""half"" for 10.99 or a ""full"" for 12.99. I went against my money-saving instincts and chose the half, because I knew I'd probably overeat if I chose the larger option.

Well, I'm glad I did. Because, after I'd added up all the ingredients in this ""half"" a salad - which was more like 1/3 the size of my roommate's ""full"" salad - it came out to just shy of my daily caloric budget! (I had around 20 calories to spare for all of yesterday, but I just wrote those off as possible errors in calculation, anyway.)

Side note, here. It's absolutely crazy to me how predatory this type of pricing structure can be. For $2 more, I would have been given nearly 3x the food. Instead of a 630 calorie salad, I'd probably been given close to 1500 or 1800 calories. For just just $2 more. That's absolutely absurd. But anyways...

I don't go out much. I could have easily stayed at home and cooked the pork chops that I will cook tonight. But I'm now proud of myself for realizing it's not a choice between my diet and my friends. Last night's venture made me realize that there will always be healthier options that fit my diet (keto) and caloric budget, even if I hadn't specifically planned for it!

I'm kinda curious if others have noticed this kind of thing when out in the wild. Have you gone against your instincts and chosen the less economical option because it fit your caloric budget? What restaurants do you steer clear of due to outrageous pricing structures like the above?",1coxuyc
loseit,Track your weight by Pokémon.,"Last year I posted a thread about weird ways to track weight. Yesterday I posted about reaching a silly goal. In each thread I mentioned tracking weight by Pokédex number. People seemed to like that both times so I thought I'd make a separate thread for it so more people could see and maybe use the idea. 

Basically, use the [Pokédex](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_National_Pok%C3%A9dex_number) and match your weight to a Pokémon. You can do weight in both pounds and kilograms for two Pokémon! 

You could also do by weight lost instead and maybe take out the decimal if you want later gens.

 I didn't think of this myself but a couple of people mentioned comparing your weight to the [weight of a Pokémon](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_weight) which I think sounds fun too. 

Let me know what Pokémon you are!",1corlyo

loseit,I don’t know what I’m doing but it’s working,"25F HW/SW: 234 CW: 215 GW: 180

I used to be 180lbs in 2019. In a blink of an eye (MY OWN ACTIONS), I gained 50lbs. I wear the same outfit every single day. I have 4 of the same or very similar leggings and stretchy jeans and the same grey top or sweater. I stopped taking care of myself and had to deal with the consequences of my actions. 

In Jan 2023 I had a wake up call when I couldn’t even look at myself in the mirror anymore. I picked up bad habits like trying not to eat for the day which just made me binge eat at night. I would lose 2lbs and then gain them back. I worked out and lost 2lbs and then gain them back. I swore that nothing was working for me. I convinced myself that I couldn’t lose weight and I tried everything. I was trying to lose weight for monthsss and nothing changed.

Long story short, I took my blood pressure about 3 months ago and it was so high. It was another wake up call. I got my shit together and told myself I would make small changes even if the scale didn’t move. I stopped eating past 7pm. I stopped snacking. I stopped drinking soda with every meal. I did small work outs I saw on tik tok. I started to look at calories in the food I was eating but I wasn’t being strict with it. 

I am now 216! I know this isn’t a big difference but I feel more motivated than ever. I just wanted to post this for the people who have no idea what they’re doing. I have no idea how to calorie count, I don’t weigh my food, and I don’t know anything about carbs/protein or anything like that.

- Current weight: 156/23%

- Goal weight: 140

- Height: 6’

- Starting date: April 1st 

- Calorie goal: 1200 

- Exercise: daily walk and yoga, some squats, crunches, occasional skiing, hiking, etc.

- I’m using the MyFitnessPal app and a GE scale with FitProfile App. 

I’ll be honest. Before I gained weight on birth control (Nexplanon) I always thought maintaining or losing weight was simple. Eat healthy. Stay active. Right? Wrong. Hormones, mental health, and calories all matter too. And I know there are physical health conditions that can cause weight gain too. 

I went from 135-140 (my lifetime normal range aside from when I was in the Army—I gained 15 pounds of muscle—and when I was pregnant) to 166 over about 9 months on birth control. I might’ve been slightly less active and eaten slightly more calories during this time due to stress/depression (also caused by the birth control) but it wasn’t too far outside my normal habits. Just less hiking on weekends, more alcohol (from basically nothing to 1-2 drinks on weekends), and more snacking during/after work. I still ate healthy, stayed fairly active, and didn’t drink during the week. 

It took downloading a calorie tracker to see that my maintenance calories would have been around 1900-2000 but I probably ate 2200+. That’s all it took. To get back to my normal, I needed to cut way down. 

At the beginning of April, I got my birth control implant removed. I lost weight pretty quickly at first, so that was likely 5-6 pounds of excess water weight. Since then, it’s been pretty slow. Part of that is that I have been gaining muscle though. I’ve lost 3% body fat so I think that’s pretty good for six weeks.  

I still struggle on weekends especially, with social eating/drinking. And sometimes it’s hard not to snack after a stressful day of work. But I’ve found that eating smaller meals (protein shake for breakfast) allows me to have a small snack, which helps. And there are some snacks, like beef jerky, popcorn, or pickles, that have very few calories. I still occasionally treat myself to a handful of dark chocolate chips though. I just make sure to track it. And if I go over my goal? I walk extra or do more yoga. 

It’s a lot more work than I expected, but it’s not impossible. I couldn’t have gotten this far without this subreddit, so thanks!

loseit,I wish I started calorie counting earlier,"I’ve been trying to lose weight my entire life. At 326 pounds on January 1st 2023, I did dry January and stopped eating out. I lost about 8 pounds that month. I made huge changes to my diet and lost like 20 pounds over the next couple months. By July, I stalled out with almost 30 pounds of weight loss. At this point, I accepted that I need to exercise. Picking up exercises like mountain biking and long walks as well as eating clean helped me lose about 30 more pounds by January 2024. 

In total, it was 60 pounds all of last year. I wish I could say it was consistent weight loss but it was far from that. I had weeks of not losing and then I’d lose 5-7 pounds in a week. I feel like some weekends I’d take 2 steps backwards and I would be going to bed hungry for the next 5 days to try to undo the weekend damage. It was so hard because I feel like all I do with my friends is go out to eat and drink 😅.
The only way to lose weight was to stay home. Which isn’t sustainable. 

I’ve tried calorie counting before. Many times actually. This time around, I decided to just track everything. No cheat days and no days where I give up because I can’t calculate the restaurant food. I would simply just do my best no matter what the occasion was. Even St Patrick’s day where I logged 12 drinks and 2500 calories in corned beef, soda bread, and pot pie. 

After the first 2 weeks eating around 2k calories, I honed in on my TDEE and set my goal to 1800 calories per day.

Lo and behold, I’m consistently losing about a pound per week. I’m barely feeling hungry too. I’ve lost another 17 pounds this year since counting calories. 

This time was also different because I have a whoop that estimates my calories burned on bike rides and stuff. I’ll try to eat about half of those calories back. I feel like this really helps me not burn out. I had one day where I ate 4500 calories because I supposedly burned 5300. It was like a huge cheat day but I was still in a deficit. 

The most interesting part of calorie counting in my experience is how I seem to treat it like a monetary budget. “200 calories for that? That’s not nearly worth it” and etc. Just like how going to the movies is only half expensive when you don’t get popcorn and candy, eating a sandwich without mayo and cheese is nearly half the calories. 

Since starting tracking everything, I haven’t felt defeated after a weekend. I track everything I ate and drank when I go out, I always go over budget, but I am sure I go over by a lot less now and maybe it’s only one step back instead of 2. Some weekends it’s no steps backward! 

They say a penny saved is a penny earned. Well in that case, a calorie saved is a calorie earned too. Those 300 calories in mayo and cheese that were cut from my sandwich lets me have a giant late night bowl of yogurt and fruit. 

Anyways I just want to share my personal experience with calorie counting and why I think it’s so critical. I think the biggest mistake when people try it though is setting your calorie goal too low to sustain and not tracking every single day. Slow and steady really does win the race! It’s also making smart decisions with food. If I’ve learned anything now, it’s that 1800 calories can be A LOT of food if you minimize dairy, oil, and fats. r/volumeeating is a great resource too.

How to know if i’m retaining water or eating too much? New high intensity workout routine.

I started a high intensity exercise program a few weeks ago and haven’t lost any weight. I track calories and I feel like I am tracking accurately. However I suppose it is possible that I’m miscalculating something. I am eating a lot of protein. 

I read that you can gain weight when you first start a strenuous exercise program because the change causes you to retain water or you might be building muscle while losing fat. The program I have started is rather intense and it’s been a while since I was this active. I’m not sure if that matters.

I’ve had diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney damage, thyroid problems, high cholesterol, among other health complications.

November 2022. That was when I decided to do something about it. I signed up for the gym. My weight was 410lbs. I also made significant nutrition changes, started to track my calories and eat better foods. I also started going more to doctors, and started to get my health conditions under control. It was a challenge, but I was very determined. Today, I can proudly say that I am 264lbs. And although I still have a long way to go, I am so proud of all the progress I’ve made. All of my health markers have improved significantly. Living is so much better now, I even traveled for the first time in my life two weeks ago, went to Disney Parks without the fear of not fitting on the rides. I can honestly say that I’m the happiest I’ve been in my life. I went from a 7xl to a 2xl and sometimes even XL. I will never go back to that, EVER.

loseit,I thought I would be miserable on a low carb/sugar diet but I’m feeling great ,"Hi all :) I recently had a blood test that showed I had slightly high blood sugar so my doctor recommended a low-ish carb/sugar diet for a month to see how that affects the blood sugar. It’s not completely cutting out everything, just being mindful of the extra carbs/sugar I consume. Also high protein and fiber. Right now the focus is on lowering the blood sugar then doing a weight loss plan. 


I thought I would be miserable and starving but I feel amazing. The first 2 days were rough because I was unintentionally limiting everything I ate but then I figured out that switching portion sizes around would help a lot. 


Instead of doing carbs as the main dish I switched it to a side dish and the main meal is now the protein and veggies. 25% carbs, then 75% veggies and protein. Usually 1 cup of frozen mixed veggies every meal. Yesterday I ate a little too much of the veggies and got 40 grams of fiber which was definitely too much. It’s a good idea to work your way up rather than consume a ton of fiber when your body isn’t used to it. 


I completely cut out soda and juice. For my daily iced coffee I do 2 shots espresso, whatever milk I have (usually whole or coconut), a tablespoon of honey, and a small amount of vanilla extract. I used to do 3-4 tablespoons caramel but now I either don’t use it at all or only do a teaspoon. For my soda replacement I just drink liquid death carbonated water. I drink the flavored liquid death once a week- it does have sugar but it’s my weekly treat. 


Another thing that’s helping is tracking what I eat. I used to have trouble with it because I would be really strict with it and limit myself but now I’m using it as a learning tool. I don’t punish myself for eating too many carbs or calories- I just look at what I ate that day and figure out what I could do differently the next day. 


Not sure how to explain it but I’m just feeling amazing. I feel healthier and have more energy. It’s only been a week but I can tell I’ve lost a pound or two. ",1cot38n

- burgers (eat one bun) and extra lettuce/tomato, less sauce

loseit,I have no idea what I look like anymore??,"I feel like I genuinely don't know what I look like anymore? I didn't take a starting weight but based on my most recent weights before that, I've lost 25-30 lbs in the past 4-5 months. I'm now 178lbs, 5ft 9. I am still technically overweight. I feel like I look so much better though?? My clothes from last summer that were TIGHT are now loose, some are too big all together, I'm fitting clothes I hadn't fit since like 2017. In brands with bigger sizes like Old Navy im wearing medium, otherwise large. But when I take/see pictures of myself or even look in the mirror I'm confused. I notice every little fluctuation in bloat or whatever. I wonder if people still see me as fat/chubby. My belly is saggy under clothes from stretching in pregnancy. I'm still not ""there"" yet (aiming for 160lb). Yet when I see my friends, I absolutely do not notice these little day to day fluctuations.

Before, I knew I was perceived as chubby or frumpy, out of shape, unattractive. I had lost my sense of style, had poor posture, and was into the obese category. I felt puffy and uncomfortable in clothing. But now? I don't know how people would describe me. My friends are all really lovely polite people who have not commented on my weight loss, but it makes me wonder... do they even notice!? Is it noticeable? Was I not that big before, or not that small now? My husband only comments things like ""you are beautiful at any weight."" I know, I'm lucky to be surrounded by such kind people but it's a bit disorienting not know how you're perceived in the world. I do notice strangers being more polite, men looking at me more etc, but do I really look better or is my head just not down all the time anymore lol... I'm not going to post a photo for privacy concerns which I know is annoying, but I'm more venting about the FEELING, rather than asking anyone to solve it. I'm sure other people relate...",1coso32
loseit,"15kg lost, never thought it would happen! ","I was 80kg this time two years ago. I put on a significant amount of weight during a very difficult period in my life and the weight gain made me lose the last of my confidence. I look back at photos from then and I cringe at how unhealthy I was constantly eating takeout and junk food, how I couldn't dress properly because nothing fit anymore, and how much older I looked. It got to a point where I tried to have those diet shakes but I couldn't do it after a couple of days. I tried several times to lose weight but emotionally I wasn't there so nothing ever lasted long or worked out. Then I decided to get more serious after I booked a holiday and I lost like 10kg in a few months last year to be like 70kg. I put some of it back on after my holiday and for the rest of the year I was 73kg/74kg. End of last year I decided to get serious again and I've lost like 8kg so far. I weighed myself yesterday and I was 65kg!! So in two years I've lost 15kg. If you told me that two years ago, I never would have thought it. I keep looking at photos of me side by side now and from two years ago...it feels like two different people! I'm still building my confidence again and I want to lose another 8kg so I have a long way to go to meet my goal but I never thought I'd even get this far with my weight loss because it seemed so helpless at one point",1cojskd
loseit,"How did you know, that you hit the right target weight? ","Hi all, 

Recently discovered this sub, and it’s super captivating! 
I am F31, 5’4”, lost 87lbs, CW 144lbs 

Currently I feel that every pound lost is making me look better, and I adjust my target every time my old target was reached. 

Will I be satisfied at some point? Will I know when I reach the right weight for me? I just hit normal BMI (latest goal), so I think it’s fair to want to shed a bit more, but I feel like I look slim and healthy already. I also have loose skin, which probably contributes to wanting to loose more, since it can look like fat, but looks better when I have less fat.

But I am curious for those who reached a certain weight, did you intuitively know it was the right one for you? I was hoping that I would be happy with 132-139 range, but I have no idea if I will continue to think thinner is better? A final goal is really motivating me, since I am getting so close, but I wonder if I will know when it’s time to stop and maintain 

Thanks all 😊",1comjyh
loseit,I hate my body ,"1, 33F hate my body. I hate looking in the mirror.

I have been struggling to even eat a meal a day, normally I'll eat in seconds but now it'll take closer to an hour. I was 250ibs three weeks ago, now I am 233. I messaged my doctor about it, but it's the weekend. Should this be concerning, or have others noticed not being as hungry If they are keeping track of everything? 
For perspective, the last week average was 1500 calories and the last three days have been under 1200, one under 1000. I have also just gotten a very active job, and so I'm burning anything I eat.

loseit,Calorie tracking technology ,"We have the smart watches that can automatically track our activity, they have the ability to measure how many calories we are burning, but tracking and measuring food can be so time consuming and tedious. Some smart person needs to invent a technology that tracks the calories you are eating automatically that is uploaded so you actually know exactly how much you ate and how much you have burned. For me I find it so difficult, because I’m usually just guessing rough estimates, and I find it hard to take it seriously. (I did the whole meticulous tracking and weighing and measuring for a bit but I found it so unsustainable).
But yeah, any smart people on here, can y’all get on that because it would make people who struggle with portion control and over eating live’s a lot easier 😁",1cp8867
loseit,Lied to by Big Pasta all my life,"I've been buying an own-brand pasta as the nutritional info has the calories listed as 164cal per 100g. [https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/sainsburys-fusilli-1kg](https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/sainsburys-fusilli-1kg)

I knew that for most branded pasta, its around 350cal per 100g. I couldn't for my life figure out how the own brand pasta was less than half of calories made with the same ingredients.

This has been the 'hack' pasta that I've been loading into my volume meals as I thought I was getting essentially twice as much pasta for the same amount of calories as regular pasta. 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️

However the wool has been pulled from my eyes and I've come to the conclusion that the pasta is in fact **the same** and they've been listing the calories as cooked weight rather than dry weight. The packaging and website makes no mention of whether the nutritional info is for cooked or uncooked pasta.

I've been tricked, backstabbed and most definitely bamboozled.",1co381a

fitness,Physique Phriday,"**Welcome to the Physique Phriday thread**

What's the point of having people guess your body fat? Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - [see here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130301185720/https://paindatabase.com/body-fat/)) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have. Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.

So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.
2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and

Let's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.). This isn't a thread to announce what you find attractive in a mate. Please use the report function for any comments that are out of line.

So phittit, what's your physique pheel like this phriday?",1cj40eh

HealthyFood,/r/HealthyFood Rules - Be sure to go over this before participating in the subreddit,"Welcome to /r/HealthyFood.  This sub is for discussion of specified foods which may be considered good for us.

---

# Subreddit Content Focus

 Posts should be an examination of a specified meal and its components. See rule 4 below for specific post requirements.

**On topic:** *""Here's what I ate, what do you think of it?""*  
**Off topic:** *""What should I eat?""*

**What the subreddit focus is about** 

* **The food** - /r/HealthyFood is currently limited to posts which share a single meal and ***is for sole focus on the food*** and its nutritional content *without any other context*. Posts should be akin to the /r/food subreddit but for food with a more healthful composition. 

**What the subreddit focus is not about** 

* **The person** - The following kinds of discussion should be directed to a subreddit more directly oriented to their topics or to a health professional: diet, food naming or listing requests, health concerns, fitness, categories of foods, general nutrition, and artificial foods or supplements. 

* **Fitness, diet, or medical / health related concerns** - *Discuss your diet with a professional who, unlike participants here, can base their advice on a proper background and education, test results, your medical history, and your eating trends / habits / issues*

* **Bashing on others** - DO NOT bash people for questions about specific foods / food items, or not consuming something to your standard of perfection

* **Activism or crusading** - It's fine to have a preference. Be diverse in your participation. Being an argument looking for a place to happen is not okay. Hyperbolic or inflammatory engagement is not okay


---

# Educate, don't berate

**Keep your cool and maintain perspective. Assume people are here to learn. Offer advice and counter opinions respectfully and include links to support your claims.**

People are here to learn - They do so by asking about their food, their recipe improvement attempts, and the science as they understand it (which may or may not be accurate). If you see something offered or stated which you don't believe to be ""healthy"" or factual, rather than get angry at them, respond to offer info with sources

People are built different and have different needs - Everybody is not the same and that's okay. People come in a variety of shapes, needs, and points of view.  What may be good for you may not be ideal for someone else

Getting shitty isn't going to help - How angry / right / informative you think you are is never an exception from the rules.  Being a dick does not succeed in anything except you coming across like a dick. It doesn't change minds or get anyone to consider your point.  Walk away if you are upset.  Report it if something violates the rules

---

# The Rules of /r/HealthyFood

The rule titles below are sufficient for 99.999% of participants. Most of this is to deal with spammers and those with food based anger issues.  Unfortunately, the added detail for each rule has made this lengthy. Thank all the rule lawyers and bad actors out there who made it necessary


### 1)  [Reddiquette+](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) is required. Don't be a dick

* Disagreements are fine but personal attacks and insults are not. Trolling, insults, or antagonism towards participants, moderators, or even the community itself will result in a ban
* No witch hunts or vote complaining
* No complaint posts or comments about this or any other subreddit.  Use modmail to discuss concerns about rules and moderation
* Don't make generalizations about the subreddit or participants - It's not backed by actual data and is rarely accurate.  Don't go there just because others did not emphatically agree or vote your way
* Avoid rude non-constructive comments - don't call someone's food disgusting, gross, or make any other non-constructive criticisms
* If you claim something is unhealthy, do so respectfully and provide a source (with links)^*
* Food / Diet / Portion shaming is not allowed - Assumptions, especially by shamers, are frequently wrong. People don't all have the same goals.  A picture may show something that is a rare treat or meant for more than one. Food images here often contain swaps for healthier ingredients but are meant to appear as something else. Don't assume, ask. Don't shame.



### 2) No dietary activism / crusading

Presenting a food based POV is fine as long as it is done *respectfully* and abides by the rules. Diet wars and diet crusading are NOT welcome in this subreddit. Being a diet fan is fine. Being either a jerk diet fan or anti-fan is not okay. DO NOT;

* **engage disrespectfully towards other diets / beliefs** - It's fine to disagree. Be informative without being rude
* **engage in diet crusading or food shaming** - instead, post an example of what you think is good
* **downvote due to someone's diet preference**
* **promote or argue ethics and morals** - this is often intended to be inflammatory or to shame. It is always off topic from the focus of this subreddit as morality and ethical labels do not change the nutritional aspects of food items.
* **promote diet absolutism** - your preferred diet is not the only healthy one. You CAN say ""it is best for me"" and explain what your favorite food approach emphasizes nutritionally.
* **make specious claims** - claiming a diet cures a chronic illness is not allowed.  Saying it ""can control the symptoms of"" is fine if that is truly the case but sources should be cited
* **engage in pitchforking or brigading** - towards any subreddit, its posts, or comments
* **bias whine** - ""I'm downvoted because I'm (name food POV)"" is just shit stirring and a hollow attempt at playing victim / martyr
* **excessively advertise a diet based subreddit** - avoid promoting a related sub no more than 1/10 of your activity

### 3) No self-promotion

This sub is under constant bombardment from spammers and self-promoters.  The moderators do not have the time to be wishy washy about this. **Any violation of this rule will result in a ban**

You may not post or comment here to discuss, link to, or include content from anything you are affiliated with, including; your works, service, product, app, article, blog, site, youtube or other video, survey, market research, funding drive, social media account, etc. Accounts showing up here with descriptions or history involving spam or promotion may be banned.

### 4) Post requirements

* **ALL posts require an approval process** 
* **Required post type and focus** - Posts must be an image of a single meal and will require an added info comment for approval (refer to the directions message sent to you after submitting the post). *The post's sole focus must be on the food itself, the single meal depicted.* 
* **Post context NOT allowed** - it may not include any context regarding personal food habits or goals, requests to list or name foods, diet, what's *bad* for you, fitness, medical concerns, health issues, cure claims, artificial food, or supplements. No Meta content (use modmail)
* **Image restrictions** - A single meal image only. No video, memes, screencaps, product or nutrition labels, other images with text. or any kind of placeholder image
* **Spam and promotion** - ZERO tolerance. ZERO chance of being approved and *will only result in a ban*. Do not link to or submit content from your own site, blog, video channel, social media, etc.
* **Add the required info comment** - After you submit the post, the following info must then be added to the comment section for post approval  

   > > **Name:** (name of the meal depicted)  
   > > **Macro / micro nutrient focus:** (Identify at least 2 which are abundant or minimal in the food shown. Naming categories of foods or diet types does not qualify)  
   > > **Ingredients list or Recipe:**  (what's in it or how do you make it)

### 5) No YouTube or other video

Due to the *extremely* high rate of YouTube and other video content sharing here being spam, off-topic, or having gross misinformation, all links and refences to YouTube and other video sources are no longer allowed and will be removed. Don't share, show, link, discuss, or identify videos / channels. Attempting to end run the rule via any means may result in a ban. *We mean it. No youtube or other video.*

### 6) New, low karma, and underage accounts are restricted

* Accounts which are new - May not post. Can participate in the comments. Spend a few weeks getting to know reddit and the sub before posting 
* Accounts with low / no karma - May not post. Can participate in the comments   
* Accounts with negative karma - May not post. Accounts with more than a little negative karma may not comment  
* Accounts by minors - May not post or make any form of dietary advice requests. *Do not give dietary advice to those under 18*  

*Note: Account age and karma amounts change periodically based on spam control needs*

### ...and that may not cover everything

Though extremely rare, posts and comments may be removed and accounts may be banned at moderator discretion for reasons other than those stated in the rules. It is not possible to provide a rule for every potential problem. For example, there is no rule regarding nuclear secrets yet we would not allow posts or comments about them in the sub. The best advice we can offer on this is; Don't be a dick in any way

## About user flair

In order to encourage comment participants to use and give heavier consideration to sourced claims, automod will set a user's flair to 'cites source' for a user when they include a link to any source in their last top level comment here (a top level comment is a response to the post, not to another comment)

---

## About modmails and appeals

Nearly without exception, removals, bans, and modmails about confusion are a result of skipping or skimming  rules and notices.

We currently have *less than* 3 human mods for a sub of over 3 million subscribers.  Spam requires most of our volunteer resources. We simply don't have spare time to wade in the mud of bad faith engagement.

*When modmailing, bad faith interaction, especially being dishonest, disingenuous, rude, antagonistic, or indignant, will always be counter productive and dead ends conversation.* Instead, be honest, straightforward, aware of the rules, and have self-awareness if you violated them. If you have a heated chip on your shoulder, take a breath before responding.

Things that are not a consideration for appeals; votes, what other people or subs do, your intent, what something costs, the amount of help / info you think you can provide, opinions of the rules, your favorite sweater, etc. Following the rules, being topical, or otherwise going out bounds are the only considerations

**Before appealing a removal** 

Read removal notices, rules, and posting page notices. Removal notices provide the reason and state your options. 

**Before appealing a ban** - 

* take a breath and be civil, understand any antagonism or other bad faith engagement will end discussion
* read communications to you from the mod team including automod. The ban notice states the ban reason and provides a link to relevant context (more than one comment or post may be involved)
* ban discussion and appeals are only handled via a response to the ban message. Do not create new modmail chains to discuss your ban 
* requests for an immediate undoing of a ban because you are new or suddenly found awareness of rules and notices will NOT be granted. There is ample heads up about the rules and the need to follow them.  There are no free passes.

## Moderators needed

We'd like to add about a dozen moderators. Working to make a positive place means dealing with the negatives so this is not 'fun'. You have to deal with pests and weeds and put in work regularly to have a great garden.  If you want to help, have more than a year of history on reddit, can offer a little time every day, and aren't a dietary crusader, send us a modmail and ask about joining the mod team.

^* About ""that's unhealthy"" comments - If you have a differing opinion from the poster or others in the comments about what is healthy, it's fine to disagree provided you A) help them understand your view by backing the claim with links to sources and B) avoid being rude about it in any way. Nobody is censoring you and in fact, we are striving for the opposite. *We want you to effectively get your point across*. We want people to learn from each other and to do so it should be a discussion based on science, not ""because I said so"", which is why we require the citation links. You get to give an opinion backed by facts and help others understand your point when you add links to sources. It is positive and productive and has an actual chance of convincing others to look at it from your perspective. It also gives the other party a chance to examine what you are basing your belief on and counter any possible misunderstandings you might have. Just commenting ""that's unhealthy"" is rude and does jack shit.",iyaooy
HealthyFood,"The r/HealthyFood Help and Info Pantry Post May, 2024 - Ask general nutrition and diet related questions here","**The front page of this sub** is for sharing posts of specific / specified food, akin to the food subreddit, but for food which may be considered to be more healthful. The focus is solely on the food, its ingredient and nutritional composition, noting any recipe changes made for macro / micro adjustment.

**This pinned community post** is, at this time, for anything that is not a meal share image post, and is especially meant for questions regarding general nutrition, diet, and other personal context related queries

Participants here should:

* be human
* keep it civil
* strive to educate
* reference science / peer reviewed sources
* avoid assumptions about ingredients, serving sizes, the poster, and their diet

Participants here should not:

* berate, antagonize, inflame, or attack others
* attack or berate others for not knowing what they don't know
* spam or promote
* add context of any kind involving a health concern
* crusade or engage disrespectfully for or against any approach to food
* reference social media as a source
* add images or video
* engage in meta discussion, subreddit or account callouts, or brigading 

***Please take giving health and diet advice seriously, be careful and appropriate about it***

There is no singular magic diet for everyone on the planet. People have varying dietary needs / goals depending on physical condition, health issues, age, goals, and dietary and activity history. A 325 lb college freshman linebacker, an 85 lb underweight adult or pre-teen, and a diabetic have differing needs. 

Avoid *always* scenarios, assumptions, and generalizations. Bashing on others demanding some macro / micro is all bad or all great for every person on the planet is unrealistic and not the way to discuss food nutritive content here.

Lastly and most important, for those seeking advice here about personal diet (and those trying to sneak in health concerns), proper and accurate advice involves;

* testing to establish current values, tracking over time, and impacts from changes
* examination of medical and family history
* examination of dietary history and activity
* an accredited professional, fully and properly educated, keeping up to date with the latest peer reviewed research. This will always be many times over more accurate and safe than resorting to 1) anonymous strangers who most often are not specialists or educated on the topic 2) people who do not have the proper info to advise you for your specific circumstance and 3) the horrid but realistic possibility that anonymous uninformed sources may either unintentionally or, sadly worse, intentionally give harmful advice 

Without these things, any of the blind advice you receive may not only be wrong, it can even be dangerous.

The focus is solely on the food, its ingredient and nutritional composition, noting any recipe changes made for macro / micro adjustment.

**This pinned community post** is, at this time, for anything that is not a meal share image post, and is especially meant for questions regarding general nutrition, diet, and other personal context related queries

Participants here should:

* be human
* keep it civil
* strive to educate
* reference science / peer reviewed sources
* avoid assumptions about ingredients, serving sizes, the poster, and their diet

Participants here should not:

* berate, antagonize, inflame, or attack others
* attack or berate others for not knowing what they don't know
* spam or promote
* add context of any kind involving a health concern
* crusade or engage disrespectfully for or against any approach to food
* reference social media as a source
* add images or video
* engage in meta discussion, subreddit or account callouts, or brigading 

***Please take giving health and diet advice seriously, be careful and appropriate about it***

There is no singular magic diet for everyone on the planet. People have varying dietary needs / goals depending on physical condition, health issues, age, goals, and dietary and activity history. A 325 lb college freshman linebacker, an 85 lb underweight adult or pre-teen, and a diabetic have differing needs. 

Avoid *always* scenarios, assumptions, and generalizations. Bashing on others demanding some macro / micro is all bad or all great for every person on the planet is unrealistic and not the way to discuss food nutritive content here.

Lastly and most important, for those seeking advice here about personal diet (and those trying to sneak in health concerns), proper and accurate advice involves;

* testing to establish current values, tracking over time, and impacts from changes
* examination of medical and family history
* examination of dietary history and activity
* an accredited professional, fully and properly educated, keeping up to date with the latest peer reviewed research. This will always be many times over more accurate and safe than resorting to 1) anonymous strangers who most often are not specialists or educated on the topic 2) people who do not have the proper info to advise you for your specific circumstance and 3) the horrid but realistic possibility that anonymous uninformed sources may either unintentionally or, sadly worse, intentionally give harmful advice 

Without these things, any of the blind advice you receive may not only be wrong, it can even be dangerous.

nutrition,What's ONE popular 'health food' that you think is actually OVERRATED or not worth the hype?,"Hey everyone! There are so many foods that get marketed as 'superfoods' or must-haves for a healthy diet, but not all of them live up to the hype.

 What's one popular 'health food' that you think is overrated or just isn't worth the buzz? 

Maybe it's something that doesn't taste as good as advertised, doesn't deliver on health claims, or just doesn't fit your lifestyle. 

Share your thoughts, and let's have some fun debating our different opinions!

I'll go first: I think kale is totally overrated. Sure, it's healthy, but it’s so bitter and tough that I’d much rather get my greens from spinach or arugula instead! Plus, it’s often marketed like it's the only veggie that matters, which just isn't true.",1cowyxr

We are buying groceries so obviously I am going to pick healthy options and low calories, but everyone wants to go to some restaurants or little shops/ice cream etc. And I’m just scared of messing up, how to calculate things that don’t tell you how many calories, and how to not let go of my good progress since before thing I would struggle with overeating.

If it were up to me I’d only eat from  what I buy at the store, but obviously I’m not going to bother the other two with their experience so I’m just trying to figure out the best way to go about this while staying on track.

nutrition,I'm 280ish pounds. Trying to make a meal plan,"So. I'm 280 pounds. Big guy. I got more than a rookie's muscles but I'm not sure if I'm intermediate yet?

I still have a noticeable gut. I was around 320 lbs when I didn't exercise and had way more gut and *considerably* more fat on the arms & legs, so maybe 60 pounds of fat loss + 20 pounds of added muscle. I'm estimating here, but that's the general idea. I weighed myself recent and am 280 right now.  I'm really trying to nail down this macronutrient stuff because I'm kind of hitting a plateau on growth & fat loss. My goal is to build lean muscle to a better than average amount for my size (I think I'm 6"" 2' but it's been awhile since I checked) & fat under an acceptable level, not sure what this is percentage wise but rough goal is when my belly could not go over my belt like it always has before. The caloric total recommended to me by a fitness coach is just under 3k calories a day.

From what I can gather: three main things to help with fat loss are strength training, nutrition, and a decent amount of cardio to supplement the strength training. Doing the training, trying to maintain the cardio (6 days a week of gym + running is pretty time intensive), and I'm floundering at the meals. I'm trying to keep it to chicken breast sandwiches & protein powder abominations, but I get so hungry & tired of these same things and start caving in when family offers to go get fast food like they usually had done for me.

So, can anyone help me figure out a good way to plan food? I'm new but not inept at cooking & dunno what would work. My favorite food is chicken (preferably grilled) then likes are carrots, squash, broccoli, potatoes. Is there any way to do this without needing to cook every day?",1cp85a5
nutrition,Body recomposition,"I am struggling with the concept of body recomposition. I’ve been doing research and according to some professionals, body recomposition is a thing and then other people believe that it is totally impossible.

What if if I were to intake the correct amount of protein, have a good sleeping and exercise schedule, all while eating at a deficit. Would this help me achieve muscle gains while losing fat?",1cp4pfm
nutrition,"Do you actually need protein to eat to build muscle, or could you(in theory) only take amino acids supplements?","Seeing how proteins are essentially chains of amino acids, in a scenario where training is good and there is a calorie surplus, could you feed your muscles with ONLY amino acids supplements instead of eating your proteins?

nutrition,Brown rice cooked vs uncooked,"This is gonna be a dumb question. but I cooked 3 cups of brown rice and each cup (uncooked) is about 684 calories. When it was all done, i took my measuring cup and portioned out 4.5 cups of cooked rice. 684 x 3 = 2,052 / 4.5 comes out to  410 calories per cup (cooked). Is that right?",1cp8ybp
nutrition,Is there a contradiction in guidelines between recommended fiber intakes and caloric ratios?,"Hey all,

I'm not trying to be pedantic with this question, it's a genuine question that I have. Please let me know if I am misunderstanding anything.

-It's generally recommended for caloric ratio to include 45-65% carbs

-It's generally recommended for a carb:fiber ratio to be 5:1 in order to help keep insulin spikes under control, (or 10:1 at the worst)

-It's recommended for an adult man to have roughly 37g of fiber/day

-Some adult men with high calorie requirements might easily need \~3300 calories/day

Doing some quick math, 60% of 3300 calories = 1980 calories from carbs = 495g carbs / day

Balancing that with a carb:fiber ratio of say 8:1 would mean 62g of fiber per day, which is much higher than the recommended 37g. 

So what's the best way for this to be addressed? I can see some solutions but I'm curious to hear from this group. Some solutions:

A) Lower carbs as a calorie ratio when calories are that high (ie 35% of total calories from carbs)  
B) Accept a worse carb:fiber ratio of say 12:1  
C) Try to tolerate higher levels of fiber  
D) Other?

I look forward to reading your suggestions",1cos511

Supplements,"New rules regarding advertising, self-promotion, and marketing (2017)","Hello, everyone. 

One of our main goals for this sub is to keep the discussions as honest and informative as possible. In the spirit of transparency, we have to inform you that we get messaged semi-daily with companies requesting permission to advertise and market on /r/supplements. There are also far more companies that will skip this and just directly go into the sub and link to their products in the comments. In many cases they will also create new threads that are pure and unapologetic advertising and self-promotion. 

We want to make it clear that **marketing and advertising is unacceptable in /r/supplements**. We want to keep the discussion by users, for users. If we'd allow companies in, the sub would be ruined very quickly.

**What to avoid:**

- A Reddit username that is also a brand name

- Obvious or subtle marketing, self-promotion, and/or advertising

- Customer research

- Linking to your website which sells supplements

These rules are in-line with the [Reddit anti-spam policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/submit):

> If your contribution to Reddit consists primarily of submitting links to a business that you run, own or otherwise benefit from, tread carefully. Additionally, if you do not participate in other discussions or reply to comments and questions, you may be considered a spammer and banned from Reddit.

Doing any of the aforementioned things will in all likelihood lead to a permanent ban. Appeals may be accepted in some cases if the user is a long-term contributor to the sub and only made an innocent mistake. There will be no appeal for companies that create new accounts with brand names and come directly to /r/supplements with the intent of marketing, doing customer research, and advertising.

**What we accept:**

- Links to blogs or websites that discuss, compare, or review supplements in a neutral/scientific fashion (examples: examine.com, labdoor.com, personal blogs, etc.). However, if we suspect that the link in question is subtle advertising, we will remove it. There's also different ways to link to blogs/articles. For example, the best way would be to create a text post and summarize the article you want to link to. At the end of the post you simply link the article as a [source](www.placelinkhere.com). This is perfectly fine and it shows us that your main focus is to spread good information and not to self-promote. Direct links to well-known websites like examine or labdoor are fine as well.

- Links to research, news, or anything else relevant to supplements. Though the rules about advertising and marketing still apply

Supplements,Should I drink daily electrolytes?,"
During cardio sometimes I feel so hot and nauseous that I’ve thrown up before
Also lately I’ve had headaches here and there.
Also I had a bout of constipation and my doctor told me that I was dehydrated and did not consume enough fiber.

I noticed that whenever I drink gatorlyte and pedialyte these symptoms are eased. Would it be wise to drink electrolyte solutions daily to replenish hydration? I am a 6 foot 155 lb teenage male and I am moderately active in a moderate climate.

Supplements,"Which ""rules of thumb"" suggest that one might be taking too much iron?","I will do bloodwork soon; the requisition includes iron, so I will get to see the extent to which my iron supplementation has actually ""moved the needle"" in terms of my bloodwork, though I'm not sure to what extent iron bloodwork is a dubious and difficult thing. 

I just have a couple basic questions about ""rules of thumb"" when it comes to the issue of whether one might be taking too much iron.

1: This sounds weird, but can one use the smell of one's blood as any sort of ""rule of thumb"" at all? If you have a little cut and you touch it and get a small amount of blood on you, you might notice a ""metallic"" smell. I noticed such a ""metallic"" smell at one point, but I have no idea if it's truly the case that the ""metallic"" smell is stronger than it was before I started to supplement iron, so I have no idea if the smell is at all indicative of me having a lot more iron in my blood. And also, it's very possible that my sense of smell has improved; how strong the ""metallic"" smell is has to do with how good your sense of smell is (not just with something to do with your skin or blood), so that's a major confounder I suppose. 

2: If you take iron each day and find that you become much sharper and much more energetic in response to taking the iron, does that ""prove"" in any way that your iron levels can't be too high? **In other words, is it possible to have too-high iron levels and yet experience a noticeable and powerful benefit each day in response to taking iron?** I'm not sure what the answer is to the question that I just highlighted in bold text. Of course, one could be experiencing benefits that are ""psychological"" (placebo-related), but let's stipulate that the daily impact is actually to do with what's contained in the iron pill and wouldn't occur if the person were taking a sugar pill.",1coxi4g

Supplements, NAC stopped working - any experiences? ,"Hello!

I am a 30yo male with a fairly healthy lifestyle (doing some sports every day, 80% clean eating). I decided to take NAC a month ago, which I read could alleviate some issues that was caused by living my life to the ""fullest"" a couple of years ago if you know what I mean.

For additional context, I developed CPPS (chronic pelvin pain syndrome) about 10 years ago. I also have some OCD-ish behavior (body repetitive, intrusive thoughts) and just for fun I am also susceptible to various addictions (from which caffeine seems to be the only present currently).

I decided to take 1000mg of NOW NAC daily in the morning on an empty stomach.

The first day of taking NAC, my CPPS-s symptoms have gone completely for 4-6 hours. This is something I have not felt in **10 years**, and did not anticipate as well! Also my OCD symptoms were completely gone, which I also did not expect. To this end I feel safe to say that this was NAC and not placebo after all.

However, as I continued taking NAC, these desirable effects faded after 3 weeks and now it feels like as if I was at baseline. I don't feel depressed or anything, it just does not have any effect anymore. I've read that it can deplete glycine, molybdenum and a couple of other stuff, which I intend to supplement in the very near future.

I really want NAC to be working again as a long term solution for my issues. Has anybody found a way to successfully ""restart"" the effects of NAC again? If so, can you detail your experiences?

I plan on doing this weekly until I lose 50 pounds. I’m choosing strict water fasting cuz I felt better doing water instead of juice, not to mention the results were better compared to juice/broth.

I am avoiding sugars, eating more lean protein like chicken and turkey, high fiber, and reduced breads, as well as drinking about a gallon of water a day.

I feel great and I am not calling this a diet, I see now that this is a lifestyle I must live and will be disciplined to stay on track.

intermittentfasting,"Sudden, unanticipated, issues with constipation after switching to alternate-day IF.","This has really caught me off guard. Back in February I began IF, and decided upon 16-8 as a starting point. I'd stop eating at 8pm, and fast until noon the next day. It worked well with my schedule and lifestyle, and was relatively painless to implement. I enjoyed moderate, consistent weight loss, and I felt GREAT.

I plateaued for a while, so I switched things up to alternate day fasting. I went with a 36-12 routine, where I'd stop eating at 8pm, not eat at all the next day, then break my fast at 8am the day after. Again, I was surprised at how well my body handled this new ""shock"" to my system.

Going into week 3 of alternate-day IF, I've suddenly started having issues with constipation. For the first time in months I feel bloated and uncomfortable. My water intake remains high, and the types of food I eat hasn't really changed.

intermittentfasting,My 2 week experience on a 6/18 cycle,"Summertime is coming and I want to look more like a character from Baywatch, so, to achieve this, I decided to try cutting for an unspecified of time, with a 6/18 intermittent fasting cycle, to remove the fat around the lower stomach area. 

It was an easy switch from my eating habits, because I only needed to not eat dinner, and eat more in the morning to compensate.

The first 5 days, I really wanted to eat dinner, and my mind would fixate on food during that period. But as the days passed, the cravings went away.

By the end of week 2, I have lost around 1 kilogram of weight. The progress is definitely visible in the mirror and the belly pouch is getting smaller. The muscles all around my body are popping way more.

The crazy part is definitely the dreaming. After starting this cycle of fasting, each night I have had dreams. And most of those dreams have been very vivid.

I've tried many different lucid dreaming techniques over the years, from WILD, MILD, to reality checking, and nothing worked for me, so I gave up on the idea long ago. But last night I had my first lucid dream which was a wild experience! It's what inspired to write me this post.

I also noticed that my mind is definitely clearer and sharper. Before, Sudoku puzzles on evil difficulty were impossible for me. Now, I can solve two of those in a row, in about an hour!

So yeah, after testing out the 6/18 cycle for 2 weeks, I have had only positive effects.

intermittentfasting,Sharing my experience so far,"TL;DR AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS POST

I've decided to put this in here as yesterday I came across a post where somebody was asking how people manage to go more than 12 hours, and it may also answer questions some others may have.


My experience: 28M 5'7"" fasting from last calorie intake in the night time right through to around 6-7pm. On water and 1-2 cups of black coffee through the day. I started off just going til around 1-2pm then when I was used to that I extended the hours. Been doing it for about 3 months (2 months on the longer hours) now and am 2 stone down from around 14 st 7lb to 12 st 6lb (as of 15 minutes ago). I'm not strictly setting a target weight where I'll be happy, as once I start weight training again it may go up, but I'm just going off what I see in the mirror, and how fast my jeans fall down without a belt.

If I've had something on and missed a day of the long fasting then the first day back is always the hardest. Especially if you're not keeping yourself busy. After that it's a lot easier. I have an hour in the afternoon where I've got to fight the hunger, then it eventually passes. Then when it gets towards tea time I'm hungry again and properly enjoy my food.
 I had a day where I hadn't ate for 24 hours due to eating early on one of the days and I didn't even feel hungry. I can only imagine that this was ketosis in full effect. 

My calorie intake during the hours I'm eating is relatively low, but I'm also not diminishing any luxuries such as a pint of beer if I'm out anywhere after I've broken the fast, or the odd less healthy meal etc. as I think I'd find it too boring and end up binning it off all together (I would only consider this if my weight loss plateaus and I'm not where I want to be at). This is also the reason I don't set specific hours either, as I feel I'd just be counting down constantly. 
Other things I've tried or thought about trying in the past, I just haven't been able to commit to i.e carnivore diet or strict food planning. I did have a period of time where I came off the alcohol completely and lost a bit of weight but put it back on, and also done slimfast for a while, got to about 12 and a half really quickly, and put it back on just as quick.

I play football (⚽ this type) a couple of times a week and work as a vehicle technician so am active in work. On the days I'm playing football, which is usually at 7pm, I will break the fast at around 4.30-5pm to give myself some energy before playing.

You'll probably become more motivated when you get into it and start to notice results, even moreso when other people start noticing results. I also find that I've got more energy during the day when I'm in full swing. I thought this was a placebo affect after reading about it but I do genuinely feel a lot better in myself. I'm not feeling like I'm in a food coma after eating, and during work I'm not feeling like I can't be bothered moving after lunch. 

Another incentive is thinking about the money you're saving by not paying for food. 

TL;DR: if you can manage to get through that first day of it, you'll find each day after that easier. Don't assume you have to cut out everything during the hours you are eating.

Hope this helps a few people",1cnyzlf
intermittentfasting,My very first day,"I (35F) started yesterday, also doing CICO! I ate 1500 calories (or less) yesterday. I say maybe less because I overestimated to be safe or when I wasn't sure. CW: 197, GW: 150 (though dream weight is 135).

I was trying to do 11am to 7pm eating... I succeeded in this yesterday, my first day. I did have wooziness and I just felt sleepy (though this is good because I struggle with insomnia).

intermittentfasting,I've plateaued and not losing weight anymore. Need advice!,"Hi.

I've been fasting for 20 hours in the weekdays since May 1st (weekdays only though), and so far I lost 1.7 kg (3.9 lbs) but in the last two days I have stopped losing weight at all. Not gonna lie, I feel kinda desperate and disheartened because these fasts have **not** been easy to maintain. I would like to know what could be happening that my body is refusing to shed more weight.

Some info:

* I don't feel like having a goal weight but, I'd like to see my abs. Maybe 72 kg (160 lb) will get me there? I'm 177cm (5'8'').
* I start my fasts at 11PM and end them at 7PM of the next day. I don't consume anything other than water and black coffee without sugar during them.
* I'm currently weighing 81.8 kg (180 lbs), this is the weight I'm stuck at.
* I drink 3L of water per day without fail.
* I work out twice from Monday to Friday. My first workout is early in the morning after I wake up, and the second is at 6PM, right before my fast is complete.
* After fasts are complete, I tend to drink a half-and-half with sugar on it, but that's all the processed sugar I consume. I also tend to eat a fruit.
* I'm limiting my carb intake as much as I can, but I always eat either a small quantity of white rice, bread, or potatoes.
* I'm not used to weighing my meals, but when I do, I try not to eat more than 350g of food for dinner.
* I get 7 hours of sleep at most every night.

I want to understand what's going on. I thought I found the ""secret"" to shedding weight quickly, but now it feels like I'm fighting against an obstinate, stubborn lump of fat that refuses to leave. Not only that, I've got _a lot_ to lose and seeing my hard work not being reflected on the scale hurts, but I know I'm not knowledgeable enough about IF because I sort of started doing it without reading much about it. Any tips on what I could change or start doing, so I can shed these pounds?

Thanks in advance!

intermittentfasting,Why am I not losing weight?,"I've been doing 20:4 for five weeks now. During my eating window I'm doing Keto as well.

I used to eat carbs for every meal, have at least 2-5 sugary treats a day, snack all night, and eat heavy heavy amounts for each meal. 

For five weeks I have been fasting 20:4 and eating between 3p and 7p. I am eating a lot of lean protein. Chicken, steak, salmon, shrimp, beef for most meals with fresh veggies. Cheeses and some fruit. I use low carb tortillas a couple times a week, but that's the most processed thing I eat. Drinking a ton of water. Staying under 20g carbs a day and under 1200 calories a day.

keto,Pro Tip: Don’t eat a whole pint of Rebel ice cream,"I had a terrible day at work on Wednesday, so I decided to take a personal day Thursday. I found a keto ice cream called Rebel as a treat yourself thing and smashed a pint of the coffee chip (it was fantastic btw.) I thought 9g net carbs for the whole thing is not bad, right? I’ve only had like 5g of carbs all day. 

Well, I’ve just learned erythritol can cause diarrhea, and the pint had 34g of sugar alcohols💀. 

At least this’ll add to the 5-6 pounds I’ve already lost this week, right? 😭 I started Keto on Monday. ",1coiykp
keto,"3 weeks in, down 12 lbs. The good and the bad.","I have been mostly Carnivore-esque. My wife likes to try low carb variations, but my general diet is meat/eggs and maybe some veggie worked in. Been keto except for a single glass of OJ.

- Down 12 lbs (200lb - 188lbs) today. Luckily this keeps improving.
- Sleeping like a baby. All night, no more snoring.
- Have not really kept up on electrolytes, but feel ok. Today my legs felt a little cramped, so sipping on some LMNT. 
- Consistent, but low energy. Still feeling a big sluggish, but I was before as well. 
- Kinda depressed. Again, something from before the diet but just hit me the past few days like a ton of bricks. 

That's really it for now, looking forward to more weight loss. Can't believe I put this off for so long.",1cowf00

Add another 20 lbs when we started gaming the keto system by eating wraps, nuts to the extreme, treating ourselves to keto ice cream, etc.

keto,How to transition from weight loss to muscle gain?,"Keto has been incredible for me. I went from 310 lbs (140 kg) to 205 lbs (93 kg). I started off wearing XXXL-sized shirts, and nowadays I'm sporting M!! I feel incredibly grateful for discovering the ketogenic diet. My weightloss is almost exclusively from dieting. All exercise I did was walking and some hiking.

Now, I'm approaching my goal weight which is about another 20 lbs or 10 kg lower than where I am now. At this stage, I'm starting to care more about muscle than weight per se. I knew that I'd lose some muscle together with fat all along, and I accepted that. I lost a lot of muscle. Losing more weight right away without adding muscle would not result in me being happy with how I look. Ideally I'd like to build some muscle, and then lose some more weight but retain more muscle than I have at the present moment.

What is the correct way to proceed? I want to keep eating keto (not going back to carbs!). Do I need to up my calories?  If so, to the maintenance level or above that? Should I be very careful not to eat too much? (I'm logging everything right now) Also, should I change the composition of what I'm eating? Also, I don't know how to start exercising, but I'll maybe ask about that some other time.

keto,Still a rookie but got a few questions about Calories?,"Hey everyone so to start of I just want to give everyone an overview of my diet any feed back and opinions is greatly appreciated!! So I’ve been doing keto for about a month now and I have been loosing weight however for the first few weeks I mainly did “lions diet”, but now honestly I’ve found it a lot easier to snack on a few sunflower seeds here and there, eat a cheese stick from time to time and snack on ham etc… however that got me thinking the bases of keto is “low carbs” or “no carbs” but calories also play a small role in the diet and my question is.

1.As far as y’all go when doing keto, do you guys have a certain calorie number that you try to stay under? Or do y’all just eat?

2. If so around how many calories do you guys try to stay under?

3. Below is my daily schedule if anyone has any opinions on how I can improve on a few things please let me know and greatly appreciated


So as far as my exercise I don’t really do much like literally I wake up sit down work then after a 12-15hr shift I sleep and do it again (tbh it sucks but for rn the money isn’t bad and once a few debts are paid I plan to quit and work a more active job). If I’m being honest due to my job because I don’t do much I try to keep my intake on the lower side, as far as wht I eat on a daily it’s around 5-8g/ Carbs,    60g/fat,   70g/protein, Total Calories:900cal-1000cal

And on a heavy day where the work is stressful and I have a 30hr shift where I eat to try to stay up it’s around 5-10g/Carbs,    130g/Fat,    150g/protein, Total Calories:1500cal-2000cal

keto,I'm starting my journey again - 200lbs to lose - inspiration requested ,"Hi everyone 👋 

I'm new to this subreddit but not keto. Backstory, I started keto in 2016 at just over 300lbs. I lost 100lbs in 7 months which was amazing, but sadly due to many factors I gained it all back and more (I have BED which was controlled when I was low carb/keto and issues with food and mood. I went through a lot and coped by eating through it basically)

I am determined more than ever now and after 2 weeks I'm back in full ketosis 🎉. I have over 200lbs to lose - I'm wondering if anyone has done this journey with so much to lose? I love to see before & afters, but sadly most of these online are gastric surgery posts (which I'm not judging, it's just not helpful for me).

Inspiration keeps me motivated, especially as the cravings are hitting me hard!

Thanks in advance.

TLDR; Inspiration requested from people who have lost a significant amount of weight",1con5x2
keto,Doing keto 6 months postpartum ,"Hello. I restarted keto about 2 weeks ago to try and shift the almost 2 stones I've gained since giving birth 6 months ago. My mum tum has sort of drastically reduced which I'm not sure reflects the mere 3 lbs I've lost. Could this have something to do with being postpartum? It seems like it's definitely harder this time around to actually shift the numbers on the scale (I know it's not important, but self conscious millenial woman here). 

Im not calorie counting, but I am eating only meat, eggs and veg...and coconut milk in my daily flat white. I know I should calorie count, but it's hard to do this with a baby so I'm just being mindful instead. I'm also taking a magnesium supplement. 

If anyone has any words of wisdom for doing keto postpartum, please pass on your knowledge! It is tough with a baby, so any advice welcome!!! Thanks.",1cp0l8o

keto,What is your favorite Keto coffee creamer or homemade recipe? ,"I am slowly cutting out sugar and lowering my carbs.

When I used to make my coffee I wouldn't measure the amount of creamer. This was before looking at the nutrition chart, so I would just wait until the coffee would turn gold. Then on top of that, I would also not measure how much honey I would put in my coffee. Now that I am conscious of how much sugar and added sugar honey has, I can't enjoy my coffee or teas. 

So two questions:

1) Is there a keto friendly or acceptable honey product out there I can add to my coffee and tea?

2) What is your favorite keto coffee creamer or homemade recipe? 

Side Quiestion: Is it true that making your own keto coffee creamer cheaper than buying the keto coffee creamer products?

keto,"I did keto a few years ago and lost 36 lbs in 6 weeks, but now","Well I’ve gained it mostly back, not all, but most. Back then I was super motivated, made dishes, counted every carb. It was fun. Now I’m 1 week into keto, can’t track my weight because I drive commercial trucks otr. It’s not fun nor am I motivated. I’m doing omad because it’s easy since I drive almost 10-11 hours a day and my hunger really isn’t there because I’m not eager to eat the limited keto I can get on the road, I bought a subway salad and it was good but I had to force it down and it took 30 mins to finish(I didn’t finish it) so I’m at about 1300 or less calories for the day which is ok but man I want a cinnamon roll and a burger lol. Boiled eggs, subway salads, Cobb salads, jerky and cheese and drinking water. There really aren’t that many options. I walk into truck stops and see all the delicious carbs but I’m still staying the course. Does anyone drive otr and do keto have any suggestions? Also my company truck doesn’t have an inverter so no fridge or microwave. I guess the only upside is I’ll lose weight quickly because the lack of appetite mixed with eating less than 20 carbs a day. I want to stick this out for 7 more weeks which is two months total at the minimum. I really want to be healthy. 


Edit: just to add something, I feel very weak, but I did feel like that my first week last time but I had the most energy I ever had after that initial keto flu period. So I’m hoping the same. I mean I did go cold turkey, omad and keto. ",1cp0mj7
keto,"Electrolytes, ketosis, and hypomania-like symptoms","I'm on a journey to find out why electrolytes give me intense euphoria and uncontrollable levels of energy, that end up impacting my sleep negatively and causing jitteriness and impulsivity. The deeper I go into ketosis, i.e., when I intermittent fast and consume less than 20g of carbs daily, the more intense these symptoms become. This issue has forced me to quit the keto diet multiple times due to severe insomnia, which then spirals into anxiety.

I love keto and am determined to make it work for me. I cut out caffeine completely, I tried supplementing with Potassium Citrate and even Lithium Orotate (OTC Lithium, super small doses). I've also been working with a psychiatrist for over 6 months and she does not believe it's bipolar, although the symptoms mimic hypomania. This makes sense to me, because I never experience anything similar on a regular diet. All I can think is that it's an electrolyte imbalance, but I have no idea how to make it balanced.

The electrolyte I'm using is called LyteBalance and it only contains Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium, Phosphorus, and Chloride. It's a concentrate and is unsweetened. Although I've had the exact same effect from BioSteel.

My plan for today is to only consume water with Himalayan salt, and doubling my Magnesium Bisglycinate supplement dose from 400mg to 800mg and see if I feel hydrated enough with no muscle cramps, or other symptoms.

Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Any insights or advice? The world of trace minerals seems vast and somewhat mysterious, and I’m also curious to know how many of you supplement with potassium and/or magnesium in addition to your electrolytes.

keto,Anxious AF,"I started my journey (second time around) on February 2nd after my serious health anxiety had me believing I would die of a heart attack or a stroke from high blood sugars. Last time I had done keto I lost about 92 lbs in about 6 months. Cue pandemic and I gained a ton back. I have no idea how much I gained bc I refused to weigh myself. Last time I weighed myself was about 2 years ago and I had gained at least 68 lbs. In all honesty I probably gained it all back. Anyhow in February of this year I thought I was going to die. Blurry vision, high blood pressure and well again due to my health anxiety refused to go to the doc. I made an appointment in March for May 14. Tomorrow I go for my labs. I’m so fucking scared. I’m scared of what the numbers may be. I’m anxious to see how much I weigh. I seriously can’t believe I’ve made it this far without weighing myself. I know I’ve lost because I went from a size 18/20 and yesterday I bought a pair of size 12 non-stretchy jeans!! Woo hoo! Last time I was a size 6, so still a ways to go. 
Anyhow wish me luck. I know it sucks not having a number to compare pre-February, but I think it was the right thing to do for my mental health. It sucks though bc I do have a cheat day planned for Mother’s Day so I know I’ll probably weigh at least 10 lbs more at my doc appointment bc of all the water weight I retain when I steer the course. 

Anyhow, anyone else do this journey without weighing or knowing your numbers beforehand? I know size 18/20 to a size 12 is not super huge, but I can’t say I didn’t feel proud zipping them up with no issues!

I lost about 12lbs in 3 weeks, which in my opinion is okay seeing as I've lost close to 44lbs before keto. My starting weight was 187lbs and I'm down to 175lbs in 3 weeks. I strength train 4 times a week with one day for hiit and remaining 3 days to lift. I am doing around 60gms of fat per day, 90 to 100gm protein and below 20gm carbs (on most days, max I've done is 24gms) The only changes i made to my diet was the monk fruit sweetner which i use to sweeten my lemonade and have once a day. 
My questions are 

1. TMI - Could monk fruit cause explosive poops like literally i cannot even fart because i think some poop would leak. 

2. Am i doing okay? Most reddit posts talk about 2p 30 lbs loss in a few weeks and i feel like maybe i could change something to make it work faster/better. 

Please advice. Will be very grateful. 
Thanks xxx",1co6oe2

keto,Sleep Vastly Improved on Keto. Why?,"Howdy All,

I started back on keto on 4-20 and before this date, I was only able to sleep for maybe 4-5 hours. Staying asleep was an issue. Now, I can sleep for 7-8 hours and last night I slept for about 11 hours (I think I was on a sleep deficit). I've lost 10 lbs. so far. 

Anyone know the mechanism here why sleep is much improved? 

I am a CPAP user btw. I hope some good weight reduction reduces the need for this in the future, though I know it's not entirely dependent on weight. 

Thanks!",1codhql

vegan,Today it begins ,"Prior to today, my husband and I farmed. We kept livestock (chicken and goats the most) and produce. Today , we will no longer profit from the livestock and they’ll become pets (we never did eat them, just retired and let them live) and of my family, I am the first to go fully vegan. I’ve been vegetarian for quite some time, and this switch feels right and necessary. We will acclimate the younger children to it and the oldest 2 will be harder as they have a father who is very much a meat and potatoes guy but thankfully are very open minded and live fresh food in general.

vegan,Just a pleasantly surprising observation about people's behaviours to soy products in real life compared to online,"I'd gotten into the whole anti soy, makes you less manly, etc, stuff on social media. Not that I was actively searching for it, just while scrolling. And of course, the more you watch, the more you get recommended that sort of content. Fortunately it didn't get me to stop eating tofu, because I thought, ""hey, the science says it's ok. The people making this content are just being douches, trying to get a reaction"". But it still got to me ever so slightly. Like I would feel slightly self conscious, picking up tofu, or mock meats, or anything from the plant based section. Even made a post on this ages ago. 

It took some interactions with omnivorous dieters, out of everyone, to make me realise how much better things are irl. Like, someone telling me how much they like tofu. Or someone casually mentioning they drink soy milk. Just a few small interactions/observations like that. 

Most surprisingly, some of the experiences were again online through social media, which caused the issue to begin. Not direct interactions, but as an example, seeing a video of some Asian fitness influencer making beef and tofu. Not one fuck given about whether he was a soy boy. Just enjoying his food. (Except the part where the cow died, but point is he wasn't worrying about a bit of soy). 

Overall, just a pleasant observation I had, and wanted to share. ",1cozjd8
vegan,"""How do you expect to find a significant other ? You're a vegan, nobody likes that!""","""How do you expect to get married? Nobody wants to be with a vegan.""

My friends and family have really be getting on my case about being vegan. *And before anyone jumps in and says ""get a new family"" ""they're not your real friends' or something along those lines, please don't bother because those are not real options in my case.*

And the more I think about it, ***they maybe on to something.***

Because the odds really are stacked against vegans.  I read that less than 2% of the world population is a self-reported vegan. If there's 8 Billion people on earth,  roughly 160 million are vegan.

*sidenote: Now on top of that, I'm also a left leaning, environmentalist, LGBTQ+ ally, pro-women's rights, straight, asian male who lives in the southern United States who also works in corporate America. So the odds are REALLY stacked against anyone like me because my target demographic is all over the fucking place.*

So my question is ...

**what is the strategy for finding a bf/gf/life partner if you are vegan?**

a) Find another vegan, where there is mutual attraction

b) Find someone who is open-minded enough to become vegan (sounds like a long-term  ""i can fix them!"" project with no guarantee)

c) Find a non-vegan, and 'put up' with each other *(sounds like a recipe for disaster)*

d) Find another vegan who doesn't align with you exactly, but hey, they're vegan... close enough?

e) remain alone, wander the earth *(this is not an option, as I want a partner and biological children)*

f) ""quit"" being so morally superior and join the rest of 98% of the world population *( folks this is not a serious option, but it is an option)*

g) something else?

Anyone else think about this?",1corc8r

vegan,I'm having a vegan guest at a party but don't know what to feed her. ,"I'm having a birthday party soon (about a month from now) so there is time to think of ideas. I've never catered for a vegan before (I have catered to vegetarians before) and I'm realizing how many foods have animal products in them. I want to respect her choice to be vegan, and I don't want to make her feel excluded by not having food for her or only having veggies. So any easy and cheap vegan food suggestions to serve at a party? 

Edit: thank you to everyone who is actually providing helpful advice.

Some points to clarify: 

1. Making the whole party vegan unfortunately just isn't possible, there are a lot of people coming that we need to cater for and vegan food has become really expensive here.

2. I am not vegan, I have cut animal products out of almost every other aspect of my life, but unfortunately the vegan diet did not work for me at all, and I ended up having some pretty serious medical issues.

3. Anyone suggesting things like grass, house plants or anything like that please kindly fuck off 

4. Anyone who tries to pressure me into becoming vegan, shames me for not being able to follow a vegan diet, or suggests it's fine and I should continue the diet anyway because everyone has health issues: I mean this in the most unkind way possible:

vegan,Vegan princess cruises BAD,"I’m currently on Enchanted Princess (Princess Cruises) and I was so excited for the new vegan menu that rolled out. It’s BAD. Vegan food tastes good, it shouldn’t be like thjs. I don’t think they had a chef who specializes in vegan food making these menus. If you’re vegan and considering Princess Cruises because of their new vegan menu, I’d stay away. As far as the buffet goes, you’re looking at salads, bean salads, fries, and the only thing I thought was good, the gyros which you make yourself. The cafe on the bottom floor has zero options for food, and the pastry shop has zero options for vegans as well, unless you want cut up fruit. The free pizza spot has zero options and when I asked for a cheeseless pizza, the guy looked around like he was confused and asked me why. The salty dog has a vegan burger, but the crew didn’t know it was vegan, I found out from ripping it apart and dissecting it to find out if there was cheese in it or not.

If you think I’m being a spoiled baby, I paid $1,300 for this cruise thinking I’d get to eat good food, and it’s been awful. Princess Cruises has been doing a lot of marketing about their new vegan options and it’s bad and incredibly limited. I live in Vegas so I KNOW vegan food can be amazing, so good that non-vegans would choose it. 

Redeeming factors, crew is great. However, I and a few other guests have noticed people are really grumpy on this cruise line. People reaaaaally rude to the waitstaff and crew (which happens at any restaurant, but it’s still awful to see). I’ve been on two cruises and this is my first to the Caribbean, so I think it may just be Caribbean cruises bringing different crowds. When I went on an Alaskan cruise, everyone was SOOOOO nice and the cruise experience was so much better. I would not go on a Caribbean cruise again. ",1cof220

vegan,Optimistic or pessimistic?,"Hey everyone. I wanted to reach out and get a sense of the outlook of the vegans here and maybe what future you envision for the world. 

I personally tend to be a pretty optimistic vegan, compared to my gf especially. I believe there is a generational shift occurring in how human beings empathise with other animals and their environment. I also think the age of information has made the true impact of animal agriculture impossible to hide, and the nutritional benefits of plant based diets more widely accepted. Being a vegan will only get easier. Even something as dangerous as the carnivore diet movement seems to now be collapsing amidst a wave of sick people and high profile carnivores who are abandoning their meat only lifestyle and accepting the necessity for carbs and fibre. The carnivore diet fad actually may end up being a positive thing for the vegan movement as it looks to be showing the world just how dangerous it is to eat animals exclusively. 

Intelligent and influential people are going vegan. The perception of veganism is changing, and those who advocate for the philosophy of veganism (especially for the animals) will never give up the fight. 

I could go on, but basically I find myself hopeful. Change will be SLOW. But I believe it will happen. 

How do you feel about the state of the movement and the future of veganism in our world?

Plus, whey has excellent digestibility and doesn't have the potential heavy metal problems of some plant-based powders.

vegan,One of the most famous children magazines in my country misrepresenting veganism and vegetarianism,"I just wanted to share this with you guys, because why not.
When I was a kid I loved this magazine that schools in my country always promoted as educational and interesting. It’s basically a magazine with comics, interesting topics from various fields (biology, history, chemistry etc.). 
Its very popular, still recommended by various teachers to children around age of 7 to 12.

Since I am studying education at college, I decided to buy that magazine again and analyze it to see what kind of topics does it cover and how educational it truly is. 

I found an article about vegetation. For some reason they connected vegetation to vegetarianism. It said “Vegetarianism has expended as a movement in 20th century. They do not eat meat, but they dont mind eating milk and eggs. There were even some people who wouldnt even consider eating anything thats of animal origin and were against exploration of animals (idk why a sudden shift to past tense but okay).  Donald Watson, a member of one vegetarian association (not naming which) started a new movement and his FOLLOWERS (okay what the actual hell does that mean, they really presented veganism as a cult) he called vegans. 

P.S. they actually didnt explain what is different between vegans and vegetarians. They just assumed everyone is vegetarian (which is common in my country). They stated the following as well:

,,Why do vegetarians have that name? Well, that because they it various different herbs and OVERGROWTH (when translated to english it does sound strange, but in my language these words are very similar sounding so bear with me). They eat vegetation.” Like omnivores dont do the same, oh my god.

I got so mad im actually thinking about emailing them and ending up being a karen. What do you think?

vegan,"The ""apples and oranges"" counter argument or ""you cant compare those"" argument is often used wrongly","I come across said argument from omnivores when discussing veganism but also in other non veganism related discussions.

I feel like often people who say that ""you cant compare those"" its because they lack the ability to understand the argument being made. They think that the argument is about equation, that x is not the same as y therefore ""cant compare them"". But that isnt the case. You can compare apples to oranges, its just that they are not the same, they have similarities and differences and those can be compared.

It is a valid argument to say that x can not be compared to y if the argument that was presented tried to make a false equivolance. But most times this isnt the case.

People really dont understand metaphors and analogies. Here is one example of the ""cant compare those"" being used in error, copied from another reddit thread that talks about this ""false false equivalance error"".

**Person A**: I believe Antifa is a fascist organization.

**Person B**: How can they be a fascist organization? It says right in the name, they are anti-fascist.

**Person A**: The name doesn't matter. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea isn't democratic.

**Person B**: Are you really comparing antifa to North Korea?

Last time I came across this argument in the context of veganism was when I said that things arent wrong or right based on whether they are socially acceptable or whether they are legal or illegal. Just because people kill animals for meat and its legal and socially acceptable it does not make it morally right. And to prove this I referred to slavery being legal in the past and socially acceptable, as well as women having no rights. And the response was ""You cant compare animal farming to human slavery"". That is the false false equivalance fallacy.",1cokxop

In this case, the butterflies are raised in captivity and when they lay eggs, they raise them to larval stage then send them out. 

Since Monarchs are endangered, in theory this should help the population of Monarchs. But this is also keeping the insects captive, so I wondered: Is this ethical? Would it be different if it was a non-endangered species like Painted Lady?

vegan,I hate when people try to make an appeal to some kind of theoretical ethical meat even though that isn't even what they eat. ,"You ever get hit with the classic ""I just think if its humanly grass fed and raised in an outdoor pasture with regenerative farming practices and humanely slaughtered theres nothing wrong with eating meat"".

But then if you ask them if that's what they eat, or if they just get the factory farm meat from the grocery store like everyone else, 99.99% of the time it not only turns out its not what they usually eat. But they have in fact NEVER purchased that kind of meat in their lives. 

Yet they use this theoretical ethical meat as a shield to excuse their actions and alleviate their cognitive dissonance anyway. Like in their mind because they believe such meat exists, it makes what they are doing ok. Even if they were right, which to be clear they aren't theres no such thing as ethical climate friendly meat, its an oxymoron its litterally impossible. But even if it did exist, it would only count if they ate it exclusively. Yet they just eat meat from a factory farm 3 times a day and act like this theoretical ethical meat they aren't eating somehow makes it all ok. 

Its just really weird and profoundly stupid. Its like toddler level magical thinking, completely out of touch with reality. The delusion is mind blowing. 

Anyway I made this post most as a PSA, if you ever hear people making these sorts of appeals ""what about grass fed beef?"" ""what about regenerative agriculture?"" ""What about hunting?"" ""What about humanity slaughtered?"" ""What about outdoor raised?"". Definitely do take the time to debunk why that doesn't make it ok. But first just ask them if that's what they eat.

vegan,"So, what do vegans plan to do to win the inevitable culture war battle over lab-grown meat?","Florida has banned it and other red states are enacting similar measures.  The fact that these are happening in politically conservative parts of the United States makes it blatantly obvious that opposition to lab grown meat is based on partisan political ideology.  
Right wingers are trying to politicize lab grown meat by tying it into the broader culture war to induce moral panic about lab grown meat by portraying it as a woke.  
If lab grown meat is to succeed, it is going to require the majority of the population accepting it.  If right wingers succeed in politicizing it it means 50 percent of the population of the United States will never eat it under any circumstances.  It's just like with the covid vaccine, as soon as that became politicized we literally saw people choose death over getting vaccinated.  Like for instance there were people who required organ transplants to save their life, but they rejected it knowing they would die since they needed to be vaccinated to be eligible.  
Once something is politicized, it's game over.  
Plant meats failed because they were successfully labeled as woke, and if lab grown meat gets further politicized then it is game over for that too.

Lab grown meat represents our best chance to shift the industry away from the diabolical cruelty of animal agriculture.  If it fails, veganism fails.

So, what is the plan?  Is there any way to stop lab grown meat from becoming a left VS right culture war battle?

Some things I think could possibly help...

1. If we could convince some high profile, influential conservatives to promote it.  Elon Musk is a right wing Trumpist, but even he was convinced to replace the leather in Teslas with vegan leather and today all Teslas are vegan.  If he comes out strongly in favour of it it might make lab grown meat seem like less of a political issue and just more of a common sense issue.
2. Make it so it can be produced extremely cheaply.  If it is dirt cheap then big companies like McDonalds, Burger King, and other fast food chains may decide its worth it to use it, and then when people start eating it and find out it tastes exactly the same, maybe a lot less people will care, especially if it becomes more affordable than meat from slaughtered animals.
3. Possibly make a pro-American case for it.  Arguments about climate change won't work since climate change has been successfully politicized so therefore at least half of Americans are climate change deniers, but if we can show that it's creating American jobs and helping the economy by creating an in demand product then maybe people will find it inherently valuable.

I am really really worried lab grown meat will fail because of culture war BS. I feel it is our last chance to save the animals and it is critical we don't foul this up.",1co7was

vegan,Terrified of isolating myself from family and girlfriend as I transition to vegan.,"I am a male in my 30s and after privately struggling with my life-style for over 10 years, have decided that veganism (or something very similar) is the only defensable lifestyle for me.  I have stopped buying meat dairy and eggs but most people in my life have no idea I have done this.  At restaurants, I just act like the salad is what i prefer to eat just because its tasty.  Eventually, I am going to need to explain why I ordered the veggie burger at some social gathering.  Sometimes there isnt even a vegan option at a restaurant, am i going to just tell people im not hungry but would love  to join them for dinner?

I come from a long line of meat eaters and catch (torture) and release fishermen.  My family is environmentally aware, but their consumer habits do not reflect it at all.  My loving girlfriend of three years is not sold on the fact that any individual action can affect much of anything at all and is not thrilled that I am no longer eating tacos and burgers with her.  I am mortified to tell my family that i wont be joining them on fishing trips anymore.

I fear that I might really isolate myself from the people I love while trying to do what I believe to be right.  I feel embarrassed to order salads and veggie burgers (though they are delicious) and I feel that, by taking a moral high ground, others will feel like I am grandstanding.

Through this whole experience, I am realizing what it feels like to actually take an unpopular stance AND behave accordingly.  Being an athiest or listening to jazz and progrock are not normal for people in my family, but those have never brought this kind of shame onto me.  I feel like I am doing something horrible by going vegan.  I feel like I am insulting people and putting a wall around myself by acting in accordance with my own beliefs.  Like I am rejecting the traditions that made me who I am today.

Im not sure if im looking for advice or just want to vent.  I bet most vegans go through something like this right?  Although I am changing gradually and am OK with taking a bite of someone elses burger at a restaurant, i am afraid i wont even want to do that in a year or so when i might be fully committed.  What will i do then?  Will i just be weird and insult people with my refusal to do something i consider unjust?  Thanks for reading, soery for being long winded.",1co75vb
vegan,So I just got lab work done and got the dreaded low b12,"Hi all,

I just got lab work done and got a low b12 ruling.  I haven't even been vegan all that long (not quite a year now, with 2 or 3 slip-ups along the way - but to be fair, these slip ups were  Dr. ordered).

Anyway, my question to the group...  they are now recommending I get b12 shots. Is this the general suggested wisdom here, or is it something I can deal with just supplements or adding some different foods (I just got a b12 fortified nutritional yeast).

Anyone with some experienced advice to share would be greatly appreciated.

  
EDIT: Thank you so much for the advice/discussion.",1coqqow

vegan,Supplement/ Diet Advice,"So I just got my bloods back and I’m really vitamin D deficient- across the board. And my B12 is low too, which is weird because I take vitamin B complex daily, which should have enough supplements in it. 

Feel like I’ve let the vegan fam down and I’m a walking stereotype. Hahaha. I’m usually so careful to make sure I’m getting a really good dose of a variety of vitamins and nutrients in my diet, but obviously not. 

Specifically for those of you who have been deficient, what do you all do to keep your B12, D up? What supplement recommendations do you have for me post prescription. 

Thanks in advance guys.

vegan,Omni Family at Vegan Restaurant,"My family visited my city, and I made them go to a vegan burger place for lunch. My sister in law was very skeptical, but my dad and brother reassured her that the food is actually good. 

Her and my other brother were pleasantly that they enjoyed their meal, and my sister in law was talking about how regular burgers and milkshakes make her feel terrible but vegan versions don't. Hopefully, they'll give vegan food a try at home.

I would love to hear your success stories with getting relatives to consider vegan food!",1co38sk
vegan,Why going vegan is important,"The vegan diet holds significant importance for several reasons, encompassing individual health, environmental sustainability, animal welfare, and global food security. Here's why:

1. **Health Benefits**:
   * Vegan diets tend to be rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and legumes, which are abundant sources of essential nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants.
   * Studies have shown that vegan diets can lower the risk of certain chronic diseases, including heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer.
   * By eliminating animal products, vegans typically consume less saturated fat and cholesterol, leading to improved cholesterol levels and better overall cardiovascular health.
2. **Environmental Sustainability**:
   * Animal agriculture is a leading contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, water pollution, and habitat destruction. Adopting a vegan diet can significantly reduce one's carbon footprint and environmental impact.
   * Producing plant-based foods generally requires fewer natural resources, including land, water, and energy, compared to raising animals for food. This can help mitigate resource depletion and combat climate change.
   * By shifting away from animal agriculture, we can preserve biodiversity, protect ecosystems, and promote sustainable land use practices.
3. **Animal Welfare**:
   * Veganism aligns with the ethical principle of minimizing harm to animals. It seeks to reduce or eliminate the suffering and exploitation of animals raised for food, clothing, entertainment, and other purposes.
   * Factory farming practices often involve confinement, overcrowding, mutilation, and other forms of cruelty that cause immense suffering to animals. Choosing a vegan lifestyle helps to reject and dismantle these systems of exploitation.
4. **Food Security and Global Equity**:
   * The global demand for animal products places immense pressure on food systems and exacerbates food insecurity, particularly in developing countries where resources are scarce.
   * By transitioning to plant-based diets, we can allocate resources more efficiently, feed more people, and reduce disparities in food access and distribution.
   * Veganism promotes a more equitable and sustainable food system that prioritizes the needs of humans and the planet over the interests of profit-driven industries.

In summary, the vegan diet is important because it promotes individual health and well-being, reduces environmental degradation, addresses animal welfare concerns, and contributes to global food security and equity. Embracing veganism represents a conscious choice to live in harmony with our bodies, the natural world, and all sentient beings.",1cp6naf

vegan,F me for ordering something vegan,"I am so tired of having to explain myself every go damn time I order something vegan.
Every time I bring someone new and I just go on and order my food there’s always that question: „Why did you order the vegan option?“ always followed with the same stupid discussion, the same stupid arguments that make no sense and god forbid me from actually explaining why I do not support the mass murder of animals. Then I am the obnoxious vegan again that forces their opinion on anyone else.
I am so tired of this bs",1cnsg92
vegan,Loneliness as a vegan,"It's hard being vegan. Specially in Brazil. Specially in my city. Not because of a lack of vegan options and restaurants, which is a bit disappointing for a city within the top 5 cities with the highest GDP's in my country (some cities with lower GDP have way more vegan restaurants)

It is the fact that I've ""never"" met another vegan in person, and that feels isolating. I say ""never"" because I've met 2 one month vegans (they quit veganism in 1 month or less)

The point is. It feels isolating to be the only vegan you know. To see all of your friends eating non vegan and knowing that none of them would actually go vegan.

I have no idea where I could find other vegans here, our local culture and history also makes it harder for new vegans.

At least I do dream about moving out to a state with more vegans which also has some vegan events so maybe this loneliness will ease there. I'm saving up money to do so.

In the mean time. How could I deal with this loneliness? Could online veg friends help with that? Haven't made any with similar interests (tbh, I think that online friendships need more interests in common to keep it alive than irl ones)",1co1lv0
vegan,I want to eat salmon HELP,"I've been vegan since 2020 but vegetarian all my life; I'm 27 and have never eaten animals. My mother is also vegetarian, so she raised me this way. But I have a very big problem: I'm feeling a strong urge to eat salmon because of its color and texture. 

I haven't been close enough to know the smell. As I said, I've never consumed animals, and it would be very significant psychologically for me because it would feel like breaking all my beliefs, values, and customs. I would feel like I'm betraying myself and my mother.

 I've rehearsed all possible arguments against this because I've spent my whole life defending this ethical and moral stance, which I know to be true.This is a matter of curiosity linked to palate, not a rational issue, and although I'm far from doing it because it would dirty part of my identity, it's a horrible magnetism, and I feel in deep conflict.Has anyone else been through something like this?

 I would like to hear your anecdote; I think it would help me a lot to talk to someone who has gone through the same process.

vegan,No longer vegan,"I had let a spider alive before.    
I had let flies and ants live before.    
Spiders predate on such similar insects.    
This was a time I might have faced the predator-killing theory.    
I don't know if minimising insect natalism is worth it, or if natalism would overall be capped by limited resources anyway.    
Perhaps in this environment, the spider would starve to death.  

The spider seemed panickingly fearful on my murderous approach.    
Not my prior examination and dwelling.    
Insect sentience is convincing.    
I didn't want the spider's blood to leak onto my fingers, through the tissue (folded once).

Since we still have enough time, I’ve decided to just take over the majority of the food. I’m planning to get a veggie tray and hummus, and maybe a fruit and cheese board. 

What are some good savory vegetarian recipes for a party like this? I was thinking of throwing together sandwiches with cheese, lettuce, cucumber, and tomato, but want something a little fancier. Yes I’m being kind of petty and I want to blow everyone away with the food options 😂

I was also thinking falafel or maybe barbecue tofu? There will only be about 30 people there, so I don’t mind an elaborate recipe. 

Edit: y’all are amazing lol, I was not expecting this many comments. There are some great suggestions here!

vegetarian,Looking for a cookbook,"Hey everybody! My mom is on the hunt for a vegetarian cookbook from the 60’s-70’s that she used to have. I only have random and probably unhelpful details about it, but she’s determined to find it so I figured this sub was worth a shot. 

1. It is not the vegetarian epicure. I own the first and second editions and she swears it is neither. 

2. It has no pictures, drawn or photographed. 

3. It apparently has a really bangin recipe for a noodle kugel, and an exceptional brown bread recipe. Note, this is not a canned Boston brown bread vibe, more of a whole wheat, molasses, oaty situation. 

4. Possibly the least helpful bit of information I’ve gleaned is that it was a paperback that was a bit too thick to be a paperback. Also by the time she received this particular cookbook it no longer had a front cover, so I have no earthly idea what the cover art looked like. If I did, I likely would have found the cookbook online without too much trouble. 

I’m pretty stumped but my Gen X mother is convinced that her Gen Z kids can find absolutely anything and everything on the internet and I dare not disappoint her, so I’m turning to you all for help. Also, if this is not the ideal subreddit to go to for this question, I would really appreciate a nudge in the right direction! Thanks everybody!  ",1cit8xa

I don't want to just feed her pb&j every day, although I have no problem with it as a general rule. We don't always have leftovers or at least a significant amount of leftovers of our dinners for that to be a viable option, as we as the rest of the family do not eat vegetarian every day.

vegetarian,My Vegetarian Story,"Hello - I am new to this sub and curious if anyone has a similar experience with vegetarianism to my own or any questions/comments. I was not raised in a vegetarian household and can't say I met any other strict vegetarians until heading to college. I was never comfortable eating much meat as a young child, and once I understood the concept of it I was even more turned away. I believe I took on the vegetarian label around second or third grade. Since I wasn't raised around any other vegetarians, I had to slowly phase out products with animal-based ingredients (gelatin, stock, tallow, rennet, etc) as I became aware of them. Dairy is fine by me, although I generally avoid eggs both by their lonesome and when included as a noticeable ingredient. I can't say I have any need or desire to consider changing any of this. thanks!",1c216v5
vegetarian,Invited to a very non-vegetarian birthday dinner,"Hey all! I’m in a bit of a pickle…I was invited to a friend’s birthday dinner, hosted by another friend, and found out that they will be serving soup that is very much not vegetarian. This is the only thing being served as far as I know, so my usual tactic of just making a meal of vegetarian sides does not apply. I don’t want to ask that they make the dish vegetarian, because this dinner is not for me, it’s our mutual friend’s birthday! (Everyone there knows I am vegetarian).

When you find yourself in this situation, what do you do? I was thinking of just eating before I get there, but I will feel awkward sitting at the table while they eat, and I don’t want to make a big deal of it. Is it rude to make a small dish for myself and bring to eat it? For the record, I am already bringing the dessert.

Edit / Update: thanks everyone for the advice and encouragement! I spoke with the host, and I’m going to bring a small vegetarian version (the dish is pho for those who were wondering) as well as some vegetarian spring rolls to share with everyone! I felt like this made it so I could participate in the meal with everyone else (it’s a small 5 person dinner party) and also doesn’t exclude people from what I bring! Honestly it’s more than I wanted to spend, but it saves me from my own awkward self and keeps me from second guessing if I’m being rude. 

For anyone else that finds themselves in a similar scenario, I would second the advice that you should communicate with the host before you bring anything. In my case this is more informal than most birthday dinners I’ve been to or hosted, but I think most people appreciate a heads up so they can make sure they can accommodate room for the dish / make sure to make time to reheat what you bring.",1c1f2mu
vegetarian,Storage and preservation of produce,"Hi Y'all,

I am not a vegetarian, but I am looking to increase my plant matter.  Currently, I eat very little in terms of fruit and vegetables.

vegetarian,Tofu is back on the menu!! I finally figured out how to make it taste great for me.,"Over the years, I've given up on tofu dozens of times but I keep coming back to try again because it's so cheap, you know? This time, I think I found a winning method - 

First step is to buy tofu packs and shove them straight into the freezer, unopened. Leave them in there until you're ready for some tofu. It doesn't actually have to be frozen, I just like keeping it on hand in the freezer instead of the fridge.

Second step is **critical, BOIL YOUR TOFU!!** Apparently this is how Chinese restaurants prepare their tofu, they blanch it. I broke my tofu block into generous pieces and boiled it in salted water for 15-20 minutes, gentle boil. Drain and rinse in cold water until the pieces can be handled.

Put the pieces on a towel or press and drain. Drain it as much as you desire; I left mine tightly rolled in a towel for a few hours. 

Cook the tofu however you like. I coated mine in a coconut flour/oat fiber/psyllium husk powder blend with spices, airfried at 425F for 15 minutes, coated the pieces in sugar-free mongolian sauce, then back into the air-fryer for 5 minutes.

It's soooooooooooooooooo freakin yummy and not even a hint of soy flavor. The boiling really removes the majority of the soy smell and flavor imo.",1bv6rqv

GERD,Sudden onset symptoms lasting a month - chest pain and constant burping after meals,"Here I am, reporting for duty as the latest middle-aged head case with health anxiety and symptoms that could mean any of twelve different things. I’m 39 with no apparent history of GERD, but everyone on one side of the family has it. I smoked through my twenties, switched to vaping, and gave that up a year ago. I have a stressful job, I’m a single dad, and I’ve been drinking too much for a few years. 

A little more than a month ago I woke up with tightness under my sternum and intermittent dizziness that lasted all day. It persisted for a week, at which point I hit the urgent care and got a prescription for 40mg of pantoprazole each morning. I stopped drinking, cut out all fried foods, and started eating much smaller meals, which resulted in about five pounds of weight loss. The dizziness is now gone and the tightness is minor and infrequent. 

Over the past week, I’ve started burping about an hour after every meal. They’re small burps, occurring every few minutes, and I almost feel like I have to push them out. Sometimes they feel like a combination of a hiccup and a burp, and sometimes they feel like food is rising back up out of my stomach, though I don’t regurgitate. This can go on for hours. 

I spoke with a gastro doc and I have a scope scheduled in a month. Does this sound familiar to anyone? I’m doing everything I can not to catastrophize. Has anyone else had this sort of thing happen out of blue and progress like this? Thanks in advance for indulging my neuroticism. ",1cp6lp3

Don't know what triggers it, but it's debilitating. I can't do anything while it happens and I can barely think straight. Over the counter meds barely do anything.

I've been back home for months and the coughing is still gone. I didnt even notice initially, but friends and family commented on my lack of cough. What could be the reason? Did the different bacteria in the food there help my gut biome? Was the food less processed, allowing my body time to heal?

Anyways, I'm wondering, for those of you who have done an endoscopy before, do you have any advice on how to prepare, what the procedure is like, or what the recovery is like?

GERD,Advice for Repeated Vomiting /w DES & Pyloric Stenosis,"Looking for some advice for my wife who has been on a long journey marked with frequent and unpredictable vomiting.  Starting at the beginning of last year, she began to throw-up at seemingly random times.  It started once every couple of weeks, and over the course of a year progressed to being an almost daily occurrence.  She also has horrible bouts of constepation.

The vomiting happens mostly at night.  She says she can feel it in her chest, and at that point she knows it's coming up some time that night.  Sometimes, just leaning over will result in regurgitation.

She's had around 6 scopes, just about every test imaginable.  The diagnoses so far have been:

* Pyloric Stenosis
* Diffuse Esophogel Spasms
* Possible Lupas

To resolve the Pylogic Stenosis, she had the stretching procedure, which seemed to help out for a week or two. After that, she had the stretching procedure with the addition to botox injections, and this unfortunately seemed to have almost no effect at all that time around.

For the DES, she was prescribed a tricyclic antidepressant.  This hasn't provided much relief so far, but her dose was just doubled to see if that would help.

So far, the DES seems like the most logical diagnosis.  But she has never actually felt spasms before.  She just experiences the vomiting.  The doctor said the monometry test was solid for DES.

The only consistent relief we've been able to achieve is for her to eat very early in the evening (4:00 - 5:00) and try to consume only liquid or very soft foods. This definitely helps, but even with this approach she gets sick maybe 50% of the time, and is frequently nausous.

We've really hoping that the DES diagnosis is the main culprit, and there is some medicine or procedures that will resolve it, but I'm sorta skeptical because of the fact that she never really notices any spasms, and it seems that with her severe case of vomiting these spasms would be detectable.  But maybe not.

We're grasping at straws, so any advice would be appreciated.

GERD,Success experiment with trigger foods ,"I have LPR/GERD. I've been experimenting with eating very small amounts of trigger foods. My assumption is that I can accustom my stomach with them, to the point that they do not cause problems any longer.

I did that with whole yogurt and it worked. I had very small amounts of it in the first days, with some problems. In the next days the problems lessened and I increased the intake. Now I'm eating a whole serving with no problems. That took about 10 days. Now I'm doing the same with peanut butter and it's working as well.

The same thing happened with arm exercises. For some reason, any arm exercise I did (like push-ups) would have me cough the whole day and cause other problems to my throat. I then decide to take it slowly and progressed from there. The fifth day I was already without any symptoms. I do 2x50 push-ups now every other day, among other arms exercises.


TL;DR: The logic to cure allergies -- that is, start with very small amounts of foods that cause allergies and increase intake slowly -- seems to be applicable to LPR/GERD.",1cos7wd

I try my very best to not eat too close to laying down - I usually wait at least 3 hours before doing so, but last night I went to bed within 2 hours of eating a large dinner and this 100% caused these symptoms.

GERD,Severe chest pain from acid reflux?,"I am currently on my second round of Pantoprazole 40mg (prescribed by a doctor). I take 1 tablet daily and have been for the past 3 months. It definitely works and completely eliminates my acid reflux problems, which used to be almost unbearable. I sometimes forget to take my dose before I go to bed and then the next day I am in agony, but not so much from the acid reflux burning sensation. 

It seems whenever I miss a dose, I get severe chest pains almost directly below my heart. The only way to relieve this is to burp non stop until I feel a huge release of air. Sometimes it takes 30 burps, sometimes it takes up to 100 all occurring one after another. The chest pain gets so bad it is hard to move. I missed my dose last night and just 20 minutes ago I had the worst pain yet. I was lying down in bed and felt a slight cramp come on in my chest and went to sit up to try to relieve it. The second I went to sit up the intensity of the pain increased significantly and I was physically stuck in a half sitting half lying down position as any slight movement sent a stabbing sensation through my chest. It took 2-3 minutes to move from this position to a fully sitting position, and then I burped 30-40 times before the pain finally went away. 

Does anyone else experience symptoms like this? I mentioned to my doctor that I sometimes get chest pains and she seemed to brush it off. This makes me think that it may be somewhat common. I am planning on going back to the doctor in a few weeks to get another prescription refill and plan on discussing it again with them, but in the meantime I wanted to see if anyone else has had or is having a similar experience.

Basically my symptoms were a lot of GERD bad allergies, constant post nasal drip, cant eat anything because it causes mucus phlegm when I eat and I couldn't eat anything.

 Post nasal drip phlegm when trying to eat cannot eat anything. Cant eat phlegm mucus cant eat(Repeating for algorithim) Gerd heartburn allergies cannot eat allergies cant eat gerd phlegm cant eat allergies.

I was only getting in about 800 calories a day tops and I could only eat extremely bland foods or I would start basically choking on phlegm. As soon as I would take a bite, phlegm mucus would immediately form in my throat and it was borderline choking. 

Allergy medicine helped a lot and Gerd medicine helped basically none that I noticed and when I quit gerd medicine I didnt get any acid relapse either. Doesnt mean you shouldnt take these.

Something IMPORTANT. I didnt realize it at the time but you often will get gerd from not eating much. Your acid basically has nothing to do so it acts a fool in your stomach. 

I believe what caused my situation was both gerd and allergies at the same time. I drank (not even a lot) of alcohol for a few years and then I was drinking lemon water mixed with vinegar which I believed pushed me over the edge. I had also been eating fast food for breakfast lunch and dinner for 5 years. I believe all of this caused a slight abrasion (forgot the medical term) in my stomach and sent me into a bad spot. For the first week i had a frog in my throat my gerd was so bad and just sipping water in the morning made a volcano go off in my throat and chest.

I lived off of chicken noodle soup with crackers, almond milk + cheerios cereal, animal crackers (these still caused slight phlegm), and rotisserie chicken somehow too. Lost tons of weight.

Another reminder. Once your gut/stomach heals and you can eat normally again you will feel massive bloating when eating small meals. Dont panic. That's just from your stomach having shrinked from not eating so long. It will grow again and you'll be fine. 

Your gut can usually be healed if this is something you did to yourself like I did through poor life choices. But it takes a long time depending on how bad your diet was. Just once you're cured make sure to start eating clean and taking care of your body! Think about it like this, you've been sent on a bootcamp for forming food related discipline. Discipline is a muscle and you've just built a ton of It through this process. People literally pay for this type of thing. Dont waste it by going back to your old ways when your cured! Start eating clean like you've always wanted too. Use this stomach disease as a discipline bootcamp to assist you later in life. You got this! 

One more message of support: When I had this debilitating Gerd/post nasal drip/allergy combination, my parents were still married and I was living with them in the countryside. I was learning programming for the first time with my brother and there were a lot of good memories. I WISH I would have been happy and stopped focusing on my sickness. There was so much beauty in my life but I was focused on only the bad. I literally look back on the time I had this disease with fondness and nostalgia. Seriously guys it gets better. Eat your little bland crappy food and just be patient and enjoy life while your body heals.

GERD,Rabeprazole question,"Hey there,

Recently I switched from esomeprazole to rabeprazole because im taking citalopram and esomeprazole is not recommended while taking it. After starting rabeprazole im getting weird taste in my mouth and weird painful sensations in esophagus. Did somebody encounter that while on rabeprazole or its not connected?

Thx!",1conl25
GERD,On and off stomach pain ,"As the title says I’m experiencing on and off pain under my left rib cage area. All started in late march I dismissed it at first because i was used to the discomfort but not pain. I should note up until early April I wasn’t on any medication as I had been off it since November. I tried Tagamet for like 16 days which seemed to help but once its effects wore off the pain would come and go. I was prescribed omeprazole at the ER (not a recent visit it was a month ago only just now decided to take the medication) and that what I’ve been on for like 2 days now, but it makes me really drowsy don’t know if that’s normal or I should be concerned about it. when the pain first started it felt like a really bad reflux attack as what I can only describe as really bad indigestion, back wash, and heartburn in the center of my chest. I went to see my gi in mid April and was feeling ok by that point I explained to him that I was feeling on and off pain and was told that we would try the Tagamet that for awhile and we would go from there. My doc asked me to lay down and pressed down on my stomach and when he did I felt nothing at first a few minutes pass by that once again this constant pain came back and it’s been like this since I’m honestly scared to go back to the gi as I’m afraid it might be more serious considering I took medication for 16 days with little improvement. Maybe the omeprazole might be better if I take it longer but idk :( it’s Both a scary and frustrating situation. Idk what do you guys think?  I should mention I dropped the Tagamet bc it was making my bowel movements black. ",1comebx

GERD,weird throat pain??,"this has only happened to me a few times, but it’s actually really scary and I don’t know what else it could be besides gerd. it starts with quite sharp pains and pressure in my trachea area that gets worse when I breathe in and out, and then i start having chest pain. this will last a few hours to a whole week and it makes me so nervous. i’ve been to a lung doctor and a ENT for this and they both have no idea what it is. i’m so confused and kind of scared. does anyone else have these symptoms?",1coix28
GERD,Elimination Diet?,"Has anyone done a super strict temporary diet (like 2-4 weeks)? Then reintroduce other foods slowly to see if they cause symptoms? If so, what did you eat for the strict period? I’m thinking super simple like oatmeal for breakfast, chicken, rice, sweet potatoes. 
I’ve been struggling to keep any kind of Gerd diet because everything I read people have different triggers. I have not been able to identify a single trigger food for myself. I basically have heartburn every day starting around mid day until evening. But I also have noticed if I don’t eat breakfast right away I start to feel the acid coming up on an empty stomach. 
So basically I’m thinking to do an elimination style experiment and eat super basic meals for a short time. That way I’ll know if I can actually control this with diet. Has anyone tried this and if so what did you eat?",1coc378
GERD,LPR and insomnia,"Im having severe trouble sleeping due to mucus and globus sensation in my throat constantly and a blocked nose. I am almost constantly spitting mucus and clearing my throat because swallowing it is so uncomfortable. Ive had minor symptoms going on for a year or so but suddenly it got 10x worse the past couple weeks (probably stress). My ENT suspects LPR and put me on pantaprazole while I'm taking reflux gourmet to keep it all down, which is barely helping. I'm only a few days into my prescription but I just need some hope or advice because I'm sleeping 3-5 hours a night and the lack of sleep is really starting to affect me in other ways. I immediately started eating lower acidic foods, dropped tea/coffee, sleep with raised bed 4-5 days ago after seeing the ENT. Nothing is helping and I am desperate to sleep because I am missing work due to this.

Will it get better? Do I just need to give it time? Any tips for helping the globus sensation or generally just being able to sleep?",1coifc4

GERD,Can't take it anymore,"Hey. I'm in my mid-20s, officially got diagnosed with GERD in January. Nonerosive, to be precise. H pylori was negative. The only advice I was given is to eat meals size of my fist, 5 times per day or so and avoid trigger foods. Been only offered over the counter medication, although the only ones I tried so far was Gaviscon and Gerdoff. 

My main symptoms are constant acid taste in mouth, nausea, excessive burping. I get these regardless of what I eat, healthy and bland foods included. When burping, I also often get a smell/taste of what I ate last, which is new to me. 
As for the acid taste, well, I realize now that it's the cause of my teeth enamel being worn away. I've spent thousands at this point fixing my teeth and have fillings in almost all of them, two at the risk of being replaced with implants. I use an electric toothbrush, a waterpick flosser, regular floss, a tongue scrapper and a good toothpaste, though that doesn't help at all. 

I don't have any deficiences apart from vitamin d, although I doubt there's a correlation. 

I only started feeling these symptoms a few years back, and they would come and go, though ever since November last year it feels constant. It's so odd that I lived the majority of my life with no issues whatsoever, could eat whatever whenever, and now all of a sudden, I can't. I mean, there must be a root cause, right? 

I lost quite a lot of weight, currently am underweight. I can't see myself gaining weight anytime soon with this kind of diet where I can eat almost nothing. 

I used to be quite a foodie, loved my comfort foods and trying new meals/snacks in general, so not being able to eat what I love anymore has made me depressed. I don't go out to eat anymore with anyone and I feel like I developed an anxiety when it comes to food where I'm scared to put anything in my mouth. 

I don't know how to live with it, though I really admire everyone who does, because I feel like I'm going insane personally. It's ruining the quality of my life for sure, meanwhile I had someone tell me recently how 'lucky' I'm to be able to stay so skinny. All I freaking want is a pizza.

GERD,Water helps long after a meal,"I love popping my calcium pills every now and then to stop acid reflux, but I don't always have them on hand. Today I had some homemade spaghetti with lots of gluten and sea food. Six hours later I woke up in pain, what felt like the deadliest acid ever riding up my throat and reading romantic poetry to my teeth. I didn't have my pills, so I just sat up, tried not to puke while sipping lots of water over the next half an hour. Overtime, I started burping the acid away and it calmed down, as I felt my stomach contents get a move on through my intestines.

I've had other similar experiences, and I've learned that water can be very helpful even, but it must be at least half an hour after a meal and I need to keep sipping on it for an extended period of time, definitely not as fast as a calcium pill.",1cocms3

GERD,PPIs making LPR symptoms worse?,"I’ve had mild LPR symptoms (post nasal drip, slightly mucus-y throat, mild sore throat, occasional croaky voice, occasional globus sensation mostly) and started taking 20mg omeprazole about eight weeks ago now. 

After about a week or so, the few symptoms I was having seemed to have gotten more severe. Still not terrible, but definitely a lot more noticeable than before I started taking the omeprazole.

Other things to note, I didn’t really change my diet very much until about a week or so into taking the omeprazole. Since then I’ve made sure my portions are smaller and more frequent, and I avoid spicy, acidic, and fatty foods as well as caffeine now. I also sleep at an incline and take melatonin regularly. The only things that have changed are my diet and the omeprazole.

Did anyone else have something like this happen after taking omeprazole or changing their diet to be more GERD/LPR friendly? I’m just not really sure why this is happening.",1coa8aj

GERD,What am I even supposed to do? (Chest Pain),"Hey all, first time making a reddit post so forgive me if I make a few mistakes. To start off I’m 19m and for the last 9 whole months I’ve had chest pain that comes and goes EVERY SINGLE DAY. It started on the 26th of July 2023 (yep, I remember the exact day) While I was driving my car, just suddenly got chest pain every time I took a deep breath in, I figured it had something to do with gas and would pass shortly so I left it. That pain lasted the entire day (left sided pain, around the same area as where I’d expect my heart to be) and by night time I figured it was time to go to the ER to confirm I’m not dying. Went to the hospital, they did an ECG and a chest xray, both came back completely normal, ran a few blood tests came back completely normal, said my CRP was slightly elevated (meant to be between 1-5 mine was 8) after the results came back they discharged me and told me to make an appointment with my gp. When I went to the gp she thought it would be GERD related and gave me omeprazole for 2 weeks. During those two weeks the pain in my chest gradually improved but I’m not sure if that was just time healing it or the medicines that were helping. The pain had been moving from place to place but the main area of pain where it occurs 90% of the time is the left side close to the middle of my chest near the heart. Since then till now the pain in my chest has just not gone away, I’ll still experience it once every hour or so and the pain lasts for between 1 second to 2 minutes, most of the times it’s a fleeting pain. On a scale of 1-10 it’s at most a 5-6. I’ve been to 4 different doctors who have all not been able to correctly diagnose me. First doctor gave me omeprazole, second doctor said Costochondritis, but when I had no tenderness to touch she couldn’t really explain to me why she thinks it’s Costochondritis, third doctor blamed anxiety even though i’m not an anxious person, this is pretty much the only thing in my life giving me anxiety. Last doctor quite blatantly said they don’t know but it’s not life threatening so I should just go on with my life. It’s really disheartening knowing that I literally won’t be able to understand or know why my chest hurts every day and there’s nothing I can do essentially to fix it. The pain now no longer is associated with breathing in/out, it comes on randomly, during eating, if my arms are positioned a certain way, if i sleep on 1 particular side etc. it’s a dull-ish pain but it’s extremely extremely annoying just knowing that i likely will never find an answer? Also I asked my gp to send me to a cardiologist and she declined because all the tests show 0 signs of concern and in her words “the cardiologist would ask us why we wasted their time sending a perfectly healthy patient to them.” So yep, grateful that I am healthy but so so annoyed that I won’t know what’s been causing my pain for months and how to make it better.

Now let me tell you all the tests I’ve done
CT Scan of the chest - Completely Normal
2 ECG tests - Completely Normal
An insane amount of blood tests - Completely Normal
Chest X Ray - Completely Normal
Ultrasound of the liver, kidneys and surrounding areas - Completely normal but they found minor Fatty Liver disease (however I haven’t been given any medication for this because apparently it’s extremely minimal and can be ignored)
A counsellor also did an anxiety test on me and said according to my answers I don’t even HAVE anxiety, so how can anxiety be causing my chest pain? 

Physical:
I’m 5’10/11 (179cm) and 80kg
Gained quite a bit of weight in the last year but not enough to be causing health problems I’d guess? I was 70kg (same height) in January 2023 so I’ve definitely gained weight but I exercise frequently, I play sports and go to the gym regularly, The chest pain hasn’t been aggravated during exercise. Another thing to mention is every time I run high speeds on the treadmill for more than 2 minutes I instantly develop a stitch around the right side of my tummy, which hurts when breathing in. Every single time without fail this happens, which makes running EXTREMELY annoying. 

The pain:
Left central side, Comes and goes, Feels kinda like a squeezing pain

Medication breakdown:
I’ve been given paracetamol (painkillers) didn’t help, Omeprazole for 2 weeks, then Omeprazole for 4 weeks because I had above mentioned it had gotten better during the time, but this time the omeprazole didn’t have any effect. No other medication except home remedies, no real benefit. Been to a physio and acupuncturist, not much better.

So yeah, that’s pretty much it, I’m a 19 year old who’s generally healthy with chronic chest pain feeling like an 80 year old trapped in my body. Any advice on what I can/should do next will be highly appreciated🙏

This all, in my eyes, happened very suddenly. But from what I’m seeing people can have symptoms for a while and not know it. My mother, within the past week, week and half maybe, had visited her doctor for her voice which she couldn’t really use. Doctor told her it was allergies and to take Flonase.

stroke,Brother (41m) stroke/ brain bleed,"Hello! I’m looking for people who have had a full, meaningful life after stroke. 

My brother had a stroke and brain bleed right before Easter.  He was in the ICU on a ventilator for about 10 days, then in the regular hospital about 7 days,  and has been in a great rehab since then.  His discharge date for the rehab is June 5th where he’ll probably be moved to skilled nursing until we can get home care set up.  

His stroke and brain bleed were on the left side of the brain so he is experiencing difficulty speaking, eating and right side paralysis.  

Apparently after the stroke his brain bleed was very large, almost 50%.  Because of this, we had a neurologist tell us in the ICU that they think he will be bed bound.  Another doctor told us they think he will be able to use his leg but not his right arm. 

So far in the intensive rehab program ( top 6 in the country USA) they have improved his ability to move from the bed to wheelchair, have him eating solid foods and have him walking with a leg brace and cane.  Speech is improving everyday. 

I’m wondering if people can give me any positive experiences they have had post large brain bleed? I’m hoping he’ll have a fulfilling life after all this.  His rehab team seem optimistic and always comment on how hard working and determined he is.

stroke,In-laws pushing work full time & refuse to learn basic caregiving ,"So my husband had been home a month and it’s been going well. We have a morning caregiver during M-F but it’s a stranger daily. I have had to train most of them how to put on a bedpan and help them dress my very large husband. We had a go fund me made in our honor that’s saving us for a few months. 

I have applied to handfuls of jobs every few days in between being home 24/7 with my husband. Mother in law will visit for an hour, bring a random meal, maybe sit with him while I go to the grocery store, and then head home. I will hand her his socks or things to do for him. I tried teaching her how to put the wheelchair legs on but she refused to learn “oh no I forgot my glasses can’t help!”. Her sister helped with some paperwork. I let them take the social security paperwork because the boomers seemed like they just wanted to help in some small way. My mother in law questions me all the time about jobs. Gave me a lecture on how to have a cover letter, yes woman I have been working for 20 years. I put my foot down when she makes me talk in circles and I just want to shut down. She will do this until I respond how she wants and I agree. It’s led to her yelling at me and my wallflower self has reacted back. She had mostly respected my wishes but now her sister is sending me jobs links. I have never met this woman in my almost decade marriage. I tell her im done checking in about my job hunt progress, told my mother in law, and I’ve applied to that particular job and all top companies. I say thank you and attempt as nice as possible via text.  I then get this-

“Like me, Hate me I am going to say my peace. I am busting my ass working to get SSDI processed so you and husband have some money coming in.  Since I am 40 miles away in L.A. County I need mil’s help. If you are going to disrespect her every time she comes by screaming at her that doesn’t fly with me.  Your hatred for my sister is horrible.  She’s my sister I know her better than you.  She is a sweet person and you hurt her when you talk to her like that.  You are dealing with the one who doesn’t put up with crap from anyone.  Your money is going to run out. You have no job.  You need to take ANY job until you can find what you want. That’s the real world.  When the money runs out it runs out.  
We keep our eyes on the finances and it appears we are the only ones who sees the big picture.  
MIL may ask questions because she is worried about the future
So, clean up your act. Stop upsetting my sister.  My expertise is not available until some sort sense is made out this childish disrespect.  It sounds like you are super stressed and I can see that.  Considered therapy?  Anyway, do whatever you need to do but this family b.s. is not my thing.”

I’m crumbling caregiving. They don’t care. I moved a thousand miles so his absent mother could feel better. Still this shit. I’m in a completely new state and just supposed to take a shit job and be cool with strangers in my home. I’m about to really give up. I want to control my emotions, find my peace, and work.

My hearing on my right side intensified.
Then It turned into a constant ringing.
I tried to take a step forward and I couldn't.
My legs felt like jello
I started slurring my words then drilling.
I knew what I was trying to say but I would say something completely different.
I knew right away that I had a stroke.
I told my SO that I needed to go to the ER
He thought I was faking everything because he thought I just wanted to go home.
He kept telling me that I was making a scene and to stop embarrassing him.
He thought I had low blood sugar and brought me home
As soon as I got home I fell asleep and didn’t wake up until the following Monday
When he got home from work he finally took me to the RR
That is when he finally believed that my suspicions were correct
Because he didn’t believe me and waited for days to bring me to the ER my Stroke condition is worse than what it should have been and I blame him
I also blacked out when he dragged me back to the car from the store otherwise I would’ve called emergency myself if I had my mind right and not blacked out and slept for days",1cofilv

stroke,Venting/ Google Jumpscares,"Hi everyone.  I came on here not knowing that there would even be a subreddit for strokes, I'm usually not on here tbh. I just wanted to kind of sit down and vent. I might become a regular here given the fact I don't have access to a therapist nor have friends who can help me. I apologize how long this is going to be. 

On December 11th of last year, my parents got into a fight and around an hour later, my mom (48 years old) had a stroke. During the time, I was away for college and it was my last day of finals. I was on my way to my dorm until my brother called me saying he was scared. I can't drive so being 4 hours away from home was absolutely excruciating knowing I couldn't be there for her at the time. My dad picked me up from my dorm and we went on our way back to the hospital 8 hours later. 

My mom's health before all of this happened was already declining. During the time she was dealing with perimenopause which made her have very severe hot flashes. As a result, she wouldn't move around much and would stay on her bed most of the day to keep herself cool. She was also very overweight, drank lots of caffeine, took CBD gummies, hormone therapy, took adderall, and had uncontrolled high blood pressure. She was also depressed which amplified some of the factors that lead to the stroke. My dad and I would tell her she needed to be more active somehow but she wouldn't listen to us. She's unfortunately the kind of person who must have her way at all times and can be very stubborn..but that's for a different time.  

The doctors told us while she had a stroke, she was diagnosed with RCVS (Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome). Things were going good therapy wise until she developed something called ""Frozen Shoulder"" where her arm becomes stiff and takes 2 YEARS to recover. Ever since then, she's been walking less because of the pain on her shoulder...it's slowly spreading to her arm and now she isn't able to walk as much as she used to. Her back had also started to lock but I'm not sure if it's due to the stroke..I'm just terrified that she's going to get worse again and I don't know what to do. 

The medicine for the pain make her sleepy all day and she doesn't want to be active because of it. My dad is constantly stressed and I feel so bad for him because he's our only source of income and he's also a caregiver now. I try to help him as much as i can but it's very hard to see her like this...she keeps telling me she's fine when I know she's not. 

It's not easy being able to talk about this. Every time I try to vent to a friend, they don't know how to help someone who's mom had a stroke which is honestly fair. It's just super isolating and lonely yet you have to keep a smile on your face to not be a Debby downer. 

Also, I know you shouldn't trust Google because they give out false medical information sometimes. But can someone please tell me that you're still able to live a long and regular life expectancy after a stroke? I kept seeing on Google that the average life expectancy of someone after having a stroke is five years and it freaks me out. I just want everyone in my family to be ok again. 

Thank you for listening.",1cokisn
stroke,PTSD after family members had stroke,"I'm having a hard time these days. May uncle, his kid and my brother died because of hemorragic stroke. My mom is bed ridden right now same reason.

stroke,Step-father refusing to continue any kind of rehab after getting home from rehab hospital.,"My step-father had a major stroke on April 4th, it was caused by a complete blockage of his right-side carotid artery. They tell me that the stroke happened in the middle of his brain.He still has a 'clot' on the right side of his brain, and they were not able to go in and release the blockage in his neck. Too much chance of him bleeding to death? Or something else major happening.

I wish I could say he has recovered after going to the Rehabilitation hospital for two weeks, but he hasn't. He still has some feeling in his right side and his face isn't drooping either. But he cannot use that right side at all. He also cannot speak or make any sort of noise. 

I know he just got home yesterday, he looks more alive and is eating and drinking normally, if not a little more than normal. He is not refusing his meds, he is coherent and understands perfectly well. But his right foot is slowly turning purple, and everything I read says that rehab is vitally important.

This is worrying and frustrating to me.Should I give it a rest, continue to remain silent, and let him progress at his own pace? Or should I press the matter? I need some advice.",1co4x7a

stroke,Ideas for muscle weakness,"My mom has been on a roller coaster ride between brain cancer and her recent stroke (right side, same side as where tumor impacted). She really is trying hard to do exercise at home and go to Speech, physical and occupational therapy.

(I asked for some advice in another post about supplements and diet to hopefully try to give her more energy, which is helping a bit.) But the last few days she has specifically mentioned muscle atrophy in her right thigh and a few days ago she was unable to stay standing with her walker and ended up having to sit on the ground. Does anyone have any thoughts for why her muscle would have such atrophy all of a sudden and also anything that could help it. She definitely is not over exerting the muscle as she’s been walking minimally due to her lack of motivation and so I’m not thinking that it’s overtired. It just seems like her progress and therapy has come to a complete standstill lately. Thanks for any thoughts!",1co61q6

stroke,Dad had a stroke. This is so much harder than I expected it to be,"My dad, 72, had a right side hemmoragic stroke about a month ago. I lived about an hour away from him in the city and when he wasn't answering my texts for a few days, called in a welfare check and they found him on the floor in his bedroom.

He was intubated and unconscious/sedated for a few days, and the week after that I feel like I was told he was going to die about 4 times by doctors and to prepare for it. It's been really hard. 

Luckily, against all odds, he didn't die and He's now since been extubated, he can speak well, he's eating dental soft foods on his own now, which is the level right under a regular diet, and he's now in acute physical therapy at the hospital. His memory is intact, his speech is intact, he can write with his right hand and can operate his laptop fairly well as of today. His left side is still extremely weak, but he can lift his left leg and he sits up a lot straighter now. He seems to be improving every day, little by little. 

The thing that's been the hardest, is not being able to help him. He's not sleeping well, because who does at a hospital, which then triggers confusion because hes already exhausted from the intense physical therapy he has every day. 

This evening he texted me and then called me on my cell asking me to get him from the attic because he was locked up there. I had to remind him that he's safe in his bed in the hospital and to look out his door and see the nurses station. The good news is that's the first time he was able to operate his cellphone and not only text a coherent message but find my name in his phone and call me, but his confusion freaked me out and I've spent the evening crying. I didn't expect him to text or call, for one, and I was heartbroken that he thought he was locked in the attic.

I just want my dad to be okay and I feel embarrassed for feeling sorry for my self because of how hard this is because it's so much worse for my dad. But I feel helpless. 

I have to figure out a living situation for us when he gets released because his house has stairs so that means selling the house and finding one that works, but I don't have down-payment money besides what we get for his house. I've never sold or purchased a house before so I'm also thrust into this situation. It's all so much and I'm so overwhelmed. 

I know this wa mostly me venting but does the confusion get better? Is it triggered by exhaustion? During the day he's lucid and is cracking jokes and doing well but when he gets tired either in the morning or later in the evening, he starts getting confused. 


Edit: I came to find out that he also has congestive heart failure. I feel helpless. ",1cnlysj

stroke,Sorry just venting,"

Hello, I've made posts here before talking about how my mom got a stroke and how it's been very difficult for my family to adjust to it. I just wanted to let out some of my emotions about it all. I don't know if I would call myself selfish in a way that I can't stop thinking of the past. It's always been me and her ever since I was a child. I was her only kid, and my dad used to be stationed in different places for work, so for a huge part of my childhood, I was always attached to her. My dad eventually quit his job after a super typhoon hit our country, and he wasn't home with me and my mom at that time. He said he wouldn't forgive himself if something happened to us while he was gone. Still, it's safe to say that I grew up closer to my mom. She always did everything for me, wouldn't let me help her around the house because she wanted me to focus on my studies, and I know it would leave her exhausted because she also worked as a teacher. When I started college just last year, she said that if she could, she would follow me to my boardhouse so that I wouldn't have to work myself to the bone. I sometimes go back to that conversation because I can't believe I ever overlooked how much my mom loved me, how much she did for me. And I feel pathetic that I don't know what to do now after her stroke. She spoiled me too much, I don't know how to do most things, and I really feel useless. In academics, I try my best to make her proud, but that's all I know, books and PowerPoint materials. When it happened to her, I felt like reality finally hit me in the face, that I'm nothing without her.

It happened on a Thursday, I remember it vividly. That morning, I woke up at 6 am to a message from her at 5 am, telling me good morning. I replied, and up till now, my message hasn't been seen. Because during that small amount of time in the middle, it happened to her. I only knew about it at 4 pm. I was the last in our family to know, and that makes me feel awful. My aunt told me they didn't want to surprise me too badly, that I might faint in my college if they broke the news on the phone. My cousin actually tried to tell me but in a weird way. She asked me, ""Are you coming home later?"" and I replied, ""Yeah, but I might come home at night because I have a quiz."" I asked her why she asked, and she told me she wanted me to print her something. A few weeks ago, she told me that was her trying to ""break the news"" to me but couldn't do it. My aunt eventually went to my college to get me. At first, I was happy to see her because maybe it meant I'd have free dinner, but then I saw her eyes. She'd been crying, and I knew for sure it wasn't good. She took me out of our room, and when the words ""It's your mom"" came out, I already broke down, without even knowing what happened. Just to add another thing, it happened in February, and a week prior, my uncle died, and a week prior to that, his father died. So I thought, is my family cursed or something? Why are we being picked off one by one?

I asked my classmates to tell our professor that I can't take the quiz, and they told me they understood. My aunt then brought me to the hospital where my mom was, and I could never forget the gut-wrenching dread and pain I felt when I entered those drawn curtains in the emergency room to see my mom laying on a hospital bed, her right side unable to move. And she was trying to console me! She's the one on the bed, and she was signing (she knows ASL because she teaches children with disabilities) to me, making sure if I was okay. After that, it was weeks of me staying at the visitors' lounge with my dad while my mom was in the ICU. It was the first time I saw my dad cry; he started telling me he loved me more now, when I could count the number of times he said it before on my hand. And now, here we are, almost 3 months in, and she's at home with my dad, and I'm far away. She's recovering well; she can move her right side now. When she was in the ICU, she could only move her left side. And now they're starting to rehab her for walking. She can speak freely, though her voice is more quiet. They took out her NGT just a week ago, and she's happy to be able to eat food through her mouth again.

Sometimes, when I'm alone, though, and the world gets quiet, I linger on the past. And I hate myself for it. I can't sleep some nights, scared that what if I woke up and she's no longer there? I once overheard my aunt and dad talking back in the first weeks when my mom was in critical condition, that whatever happens to my mom, they would accept it. And all I could think about was, I wouldn't. There wouldn't be a world or alternate reality out there where I would accept that. I love her so much, and I worry that maybe I didn't tell her that enough. It's mother's day on the 12th and I'm gonna surprise her with a letter given to me for being one of the top students in my course, there's gonna be a program on the 30th and I know it's just wishful thinking and probably not possible, but I really wish she could walk me up to that stage. Maybe next time, I just know she's gonna be so proud. 


I'm sorry if my story is scrambled or isn't organized well; I'm just having one of those nights, and I wanted to just vent. There's actually more I want to say, but I should probably go back to studying. If you've reached it this far, thank you so much for reading until the end. I hope you have a lovely day/night.",1cn7oij

stroke,Over caregivers provided by insurance but don’t know what to do,"

My husband has been home for almost a month and we have been approved of many hours every week for care. We started a morning schedule until I find work again but I don’t know how to trust these strangers. 

They constantly need direction or want to chat. We only have scheduled four hours a day so far, almost new people every time, and it’s me babysitting them to get tasks done. I gather everything my husband will need for the day because it was too much having them gather stuff from the bathroom and a pile of clothes near him. They ask how to put a bedpan on. They don’t do anything unless requested. Then they sit right next to me on the couch until I’m relieved when they leave. My husband will turn down tasks with the few that have been proactive, until I told him I would have to do it later unless he does it now. He gets im tired but I’m the moment he tries to be easy going for everyone. I’m just burned out. But I’m supposed to become the breadwinner now too?

Is there anyway I can turn down these caregivers until my IHSS gets approved? Am i dumb? I just don’t need an audience in my own home who are barely helpful.

stroke,Comment on: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for chronic stroke?,"I have looked at many references on this topic since my partner suffered a debilitating hemorrhagic AVM stroke eight years ago. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) involves the administration of 100% oxygen at pressures >1 atmosphere (101.3 kPa). HBOT was first proposed in the treatment of stroke 45 years ago. The benefits from limited trials have been promoted for chronic stroke patients by HBOT equipment suppliers and treatment centers, and some risks have been cited, especially for acute patients. Recent meta-analysis studies (a review of many trials) from non-aligned third parties have found limited and conflicting clinical data, and the evidence is insufficient to confirm that HBOT significantly affects outcomes after stroke. Additionally, HBOT is not normally covered by insurance companies for stroke recovery therapy because it has  not been shown to provide conclusive benefits. To date, there are no uniform criteria for the dose and session duration of HBOT in different strokes. However, HBOT remains an experimental therapy for stroke. I think the primary issue with generating conclusive medical trial results on this topic has been the small trial populations due to cost of equipment/treatment and small local populations of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke victims. There are several ongoing clinical trials sponsored by federal grants. You can find them at clinical trial.gov

I was having on and chest pain, fast heart beat, pounding in my chest, and visited the doctor yesterday and discussed my symptoms with her.

She started me on Amlodipine 5mg and I need to check my bp 3x a week then I go back in a month.  I started it last night.

I’m awake now because I felt a pain in my chest- it’s not like before where it feels like it’s pulsing, it’s constant.  Along with headache and a few other symptoms as well.

I guess my question is- does it get worse before it gets better?  Will the symptoms of high blood pressure subside as my. body gets used to the medicine?  Or should I talk to my doctor about switching to lisinoprol?",1col6qz

hypertension,Experiences weaning off of metoprolol ,"Hello, all. I want to preface this by stating that I am NOT seeking medical advice, but only inquiring about the experiences of others who may have been in a similar situation as I currently am. So I have familial hypertension, and was put on 25mg Metoprolol succinate (extended release) ~3 ish years ago. I know that metoprolol isn’t typically the first line of defense for hypertension, but I was experiencing excessive PVCs at that point in time (it’s resolved now after a successful ablation). After ablating the excessive PVCs, I was kept on Metoprolol nightly for my hypertension. Turns out the metoprolol helps my hypertension, but not as much as it should. My PCP and pulmonologist (I’m asthmatic) want me off of metoprolol completely because they say that beta blockers can aggravate asthma and that I need to be on a drug that may better treat my hypertension. So, I recently saw my PCP and he wants me to reduce my nightly metoprolol succ (er) dosage from 25mg to 12.5mg for seven nights, and then quit it altogether and begin taking Diltiazem to replace it. 

Obviously I know that the best thing to do is follow doctor’s orders and not the advice of redditors. I’m just a bit nervous as I have read several other forums and read on multiple medical websites that metoprolol withdrawal can be quite serious. I am just hoping for some insight from others that have gotten off of metoprolol themselves and what they may have experienced. 

Any feedback/insight/advice is much appreciated! ",1cob4ee

hypertension,Lower Carb Diet Blood Pressure Response Timeline?,"Hey y'all! So thankful for this community. Posted before, but I'm an otherwise healthy 34M, truly in-shape (quite lean), strength/cardio exercise 5-6x a week, normal basic and HT-related blood tests (blood glucose and A1C well within normal range) and struggling with 135-145/75 BP for years now.

I keep seeing on here that many people have had success doing low/lower carbs/sugar. TBH I love and eat carbs way too much, nearly every meal and snack.  I've never had a reason to worry about carbs because I've always been in really good shape visually at least and have always ""been able to eat whatever I want"" and at least *look* good haha, and have never had blood sugar or diabetes concerns at all. I've also always had pretty significant face and back acne, which I'm reading can be very related to carb consumption.  I'm running out of things to try to lower my systolic before medication, and starting to realize I should give low carbs a real try, but it's a big change for me and I could use some motivation from you all.

My main question is: those of you who've seen blood pressure reduction from lowering your carbs, what's the timeline? Was it something where you saw results after a few low carb meals? Days? Weeks? Months? Also if you've had success with lowering your carbs, what did you actually change and what was your goal? I'm not looking to go totally keto necessarily, so how much did you reduce carb and/or sugar intake? Did you just change to low-glycemic?

I took Lisinopril and experienced very scary vision blurring. To this day I have pretty bad floaters and I think that’s what it’s from. So I started taking metoprolol, and it made me feel so ridiculously calm, I liked it. Now I am off of it, I lost 60 pounds, and am pretty fit with lower bodyfat. I noticed though that my BP is the same. About always 140/90 on the machines, and when taken manually, with a larger cuff (I’m 6’5 and 230, was 290 before), the doctor always counts it as around 115/70 or so. I’m convinced they are lying to me or something. All machines say I’m 140/90 and I just don’t know what to do.

Then about 3 weeks after amlodipine 5mg was added. And it went to about 145/117. After two weeks my doctor upped the amlodipine to 10mg. I have been taking amlodipine 10mg from April 23 (about 2.5 weeks). My blood pressure now is at 116/96. 

My target blood pressure is 130/80, so my lower number still has some ways to go. My doctor made a follow up appointment at the end of the month (which will be a month after starting amlodipine), and made a note that if my lower number is still not at target, then we will need to evaluate whether a 3rd medicine needs to be added, and consider a secondary hypertension screening. 

I just wanted to ask the group - 

1. If any one of you are taking amlodipine 10mg, how long would you say I should give it?

2. When I meet the doctor, if my bp is still on the downward trend, would it be okay for me to ask the doctor to stay with these two meds for a month more, and see if it plateaus or reaches target?  

I wanted to check in only because this is the doctor I am working with, and while I’ve had a great experience thus far, seeing that my numbers are finally getting lower and getting closer to target, I’m wondering if waiting a few more weeks would be wise.

hypertension,HBP from Mouth Breathing without Sleep Apnea?,"Hey there everybody!
I am 34M, super healthy weight, in shape (like no brag but I have abs haha), strength/Cardio exercise 5-6 days a week religiously, normal for every regular and HT-related blood test under the sun, generally pretty healthy diet. For the last 5 years my BP has always read 135-145/75. I drink once a week if at all. I've tried cutting way back on salt and quit sugar, caffeine, and (pretty heavy) cannabis use each for a month at a time with no results.

Both doctor and cardiologist kept asking sleep apnea related questions. At first I mentally dismissed it because I'm not heavy, get regular, restful sleep, have never been told I snore regularly by my ex's, etc. But then I realized I've basically never been able to breathe through my nose. I can at rest during the daytime, but sometimes not even then, and certainly not while I'm active or horizontal (like at night). I actually saw an ENT a long time ago who told me it's just the shape/size of my turbinates, and I could have them reduced if I wanted (I didn't at the time).

This lead me to find this study, which basically showed that 100 hypertensive people my age who had a deviated septum repaired dropped their systolic BP by an average of 11-12 points within a month! It felt like a lightbulb moment! I don't have a deviated septum, but a similar almost total upper airway obstruction that leads to mouth breathing. Even more interesting, the study doesn't really tie this to sleep apnea, but lists several other mechanisms by which mouth breathing could lead to elevated BP. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4809816/

I haven't been able to find too much other info or experiences associating mouth breathing without sleep apnea to hypertension, so I wanted to ask you all, does anyone have any thoughts on this? Has anyone had a nose obstruction of any kind repaired and seen their blood pressure drop?

I have a sleep study scheduled in a couple months, and if I do have apnea, obviously will have my nose corrected. But my doctor seems to think that I should only have a turbinate reduction if I have apnea, and I'm starting to feel like it might be worthwhile even if I don't have sleep apnea. Any thoughts?

hypertension,Backsliding in one months time?,"I’ve been seeing a GP for the last five months and have been taking my blood pressure at home pretty regularly. Up to one month ago I was taking it almost everyday more than three times a day.

In the last month since my numbers were looking ok, highest being something like 140/90 and the average being 127/83 with morning readings things like 117/80 or lower, he decided I could relax on the frequency of taking my readings and only do it once or twice a week from now on (or when I feel like it).

I’m not taking any medication, and was managing my blood pressure through diet and exercise which I am grateful had some impact. Unfortunately in the last month since I was given permission to ease up on the readings, I’ve backslid and ate a lot worse, also got a lot lazier on the exercise front and likely gained a few lb. Unsurprisingly my blood pressure went up a bit and now averages something like 136/86… That being said there are other factors likely making it worse, I haven’t been sleeping well at all this last month due to work related stress.

I’m basically writing this to ask if by just getting back into the same routine I was in while taking readings super frequently I can expect to get back to the range I was in before? I’m worried because the reason I became kind of a hypochondriac over my blood pressure was to motivate my to fix it. Since my GP told me I could ease up I gave myself an excuse to deviate too far from my previous routine because it was also inextricably linked to health anxiety around my blood pressure which was admittedly making my life a lot worse even though it helped me keep exercising thereby keeping my numbers low.

I guess what I want to ask is how do I stick to that routine without becoming overly health anxious like I did before? Is it worth it to keep my numbers in the acceptable range or are my current numbers probably fine? If my numbers are so dependent on that kind of routine is it really providing me some robust measure of my long term health? ",1clemcm

I eat well and almost never have fast food or junk food. 

My mother definitely has high blood pressure and I think it probably runs in my family on that side at least so there is part of the explanation. But I don’t understand, I should have a healthy blood pressure and I never am within a healthy range when I test. I’M ONLY 20!! Does anyone else have experience with a situation like this?

I am making an appointment to speak with my doctor and get blood work done later this week so hopefully that will give some insight.

Dermatology,Why are dermatologists (cosmetic) in Korea so much better than Derms in the US?,"I've been to the dermatologist in the US many times (specifically Los Angeles) and the Derms in Korea are significantly more personable and understand the nuances of skincare much more.

The dermatologists that I've been to in LA all use lighting trickery in there before and afters to give the impressions that certain treatments are much better than they are. They use older lasers. And the majority if not all of the acne treatment in the US is strictly algorithmic and use harsh products. My derm prescribed doxycycline for 1 1/2 years and I ended up with a lot of gut issues. 

Adapalene -> 5% benzoyl peroxide -> accutane pipleline

Korean doctors use less harsh products and get better results.

Personally I'm glad that a lot of US doctors with lose their jobs to telemedicine and health tourism because the quality to price ratio here sucks.

Dermatology,Should one allow a Derm DOC to do open surgery without being able to show the patient visible aberration of the epidermis?,"**Hi there. Apologies in advance if this is out of line.**

My father had a ""particularly aggressive"" melanoma cut out of his chest/pectoral area a few years ago. It was a rather invasive procedure and took a couple months to fully heal (drainage/all that). I can link to post surgery stitch-up if anyone is curious.  It was a good bit of cutting.

**Anyway**, throughout the entire diagnosis and ultimate surgery, my father claims his doctor simply got a magnifying glass, looked at something on his chest and said ""This has to come out now!"" ... two days later, he was getting a large mass cut from his chest.

My father claims the doctor never showed him what ***appeared to the Doctor*** as an issue. 

My father also claims that he never saw anything on his body where the Dr. claims to have found something or never had any discomfort or irritation or visible agitation of the skin surface in any way around that area.  Right up to the surgery.  He was never provided any imperical data (at least visual) that there was an issue there at all.

He had gone to the dermatologist for something else entirely and the Dermatologist simply ""discovered"" the melanoma as part of the visits routine check.

So our argument (useless) over the past few years is, *""Did you really have a melanoma?""*  ;-)

This is an endless discussion because the Dr. in question never *showed* my father what the problem area was, never said, ""See here?"", etc. The Dr. just pointed at an otherwise normal appearing patch of skin and said you need surgery.

Should there not have been *SOME visible aberration of the skin* surface visible, even to a non professional, if a very problematic melanoma is present and that is *so serious it needs removal that week?*  

My father says the Dr. never showed him a visual of the problem area; the Dr. didn't even go to any lengths such as magnifying the area to better indicate the ""problem,"" or use photos or slides; he just told my Dad he had something bad and it had to come out immediately; father also says he himself never once saw anything or felt anything there.

Obviously there was ""something"" seen by the Dermatologist in question but to this day (literally this morning lol) he claims he never once saw anything in that spot.  Nor did the Dermatologist ever talk him through a visual overview of the area in question.

Perhaps it's generational but I would have at least needed visual/sensory indication of their being a problem, at least a second opinion.  I mean, how could the Dermatologist see this thing and not be able to assist my non-professional father in seeing it as well?

My father, old-school as they come, simply says, *""Well, he never showed me what he saw and removed and I personally never saw anything there or had issues with that area of my body but ... he's a doctor, right? So I just trusted him cause he said it was an ASAP issue""* 

Thanks for any insights. Pardon the essay.

Dermatology,DERM RESIDENTS / ATTENDINGS,"Hello! Currently a third year medical student in Canada deciding on Derm (unfortunately a bit late in the game). Coming into medical school, I did not have a set plan for what specialty I wanted to pursue. Rather, I wanted to experience many to see what I truly had a passion in and would enjoy doing for the rest of my life. This has given me the benefit of being able to really enjoy my time in clerkship, as I've been very open and interested to learn about everything. I realized my passion in Dermatology when I started to gather trends in what I was enjoying in different specialties. It just so happened that Dermatology encompassed many of these things (whether clinical, procedural, or lifestyle considerations). I was also lucky enough to get clerkship rotations in Plastic Surgery based skin care clinics, Family Medicine based dermatology clinics, and General Surgery skin cancer clinics which have helped to confirm my interest. There are also several great personal reasons I have developed an interest in dermatology, and I’d more than happy to share more about this but won't bore you with details here.

Unfortunately my school doesn't have a derm program, so its a tad harder to get rotations in it here. I'm wondering if any derm residents or attendings would be willing to provide some tips or advice on how to move forward to try and be successful. I would also love any advice on how to get involved in some derm research if possible. I've tried to send some emails out to dermatologists in the area as well.

Thanks everyone!!! :)",1bqcgi3

Before I tried tret, I tried everything and nothing worked. Even yet, those who had never had acne before came to me acting like they were experts at treating it, and all they would say was, ""Just wash your face bro."" I only needed to respond with, ""Yeah...I do, bro."" I mean what the hell, I do follow a skincare routine with azelaic acid, tret, etc from highstreetpharma, multiple moisturisers from cerave, spfs and all and they are like..wash your face!

SkincareAddiction,[product request] what are the best products to reduce redness and scars from cystic acne?,"hey yall, so i've recently gotten off accutane (a few months now) and I'm still struggling with redness where the acne was. 

my acne was cystic and can be chalked up to hormonal. however, prior to my breakout my skin was as smooth as a baby; now it's red and rough (small craters/scars even tho i didn't pick my acne)

my current routine involves me washing my face in the morning and putting on cerave 15spf sunscreen. at night after my shower i apply cerave body lotion to my face. during my accutane treatment i was lathering my face with aquaphor.

i've tried many things to try and lighten the scars/remove the redness but nothing seems to actually work. i've tried: pumpkin masks, hydrating masks, and a bunch of other products that are targeted for dark spots/acne scars.

SkincareAddiction,[Routine help][Acne] I want to clear up my skin but I'm kinda dumb - how does this routine look?,"I started seeing this girl. She's so beautiful and funny and nice, and I know she likes me as I am, but I want to improve my appearance for her. She deserves a guy that's gonna put effort in for her. I've neglected my acne since I was a teenager and it's never went away. My skin was really oily as a teenager, but now at 23, it's really dry. I live in a dry climate. Sometimes it still gets oily, but only on my forehead and the creases of my nose. 

I went to the derm and got tretinion. I then had to try and form a routine because I read it's not good to just use it by itself. I did research and watched YouTube channels run by dermatologists, so when I put my routine together, I kept it really basic. 

1. This Japanese cleansing oil my sister bought and didn't like so she gave to me (it's in a pink bottle)
2. The Walgreens knockoff version of the CeraVe hydrating cleanser (the green bottle)
3. Vanicream (like from the tub)
4. Tretinion .05%.
5. Vanicream again (I read to sandwich the tretinion)

Is this good? Should I add something or take something away? Replace something? Really looking for feedback. I've been doing it about four days now with no issues.

Edit: I have always used sunscreen, because my family is at risk for skin cancer. I forgot to mention that originally. In the morning, I put on blue lizard sunscreen on my face because it doesn't burn my eyes like most sunscreens do. ",1cp6cd8

I recommend reading the site for more detail.

•Myth #1: It doesn't matter what time of day I go out in the sun.

•Myth #2: I can't get sunburned or suffer skin damage when it's cloudy, rainy or during the winter.

•Myth #3: I tan but don't burn, so I don't need sunscreen.

•Myth #4: I don't need sunscreen because I have dark-colored skin.

•Myth #5: My makeup has sunscreen. That's all I need.

•Myth #6: I won't get enough Vitamin D if I wear sunscreen.

•Myth #7: Any kind of clothing protects my skin from getting too much sun.

SkincareAddiction,[Product Question] Does anyone else find that certain cleansers puff their face up like crazy?,"I remember I tried using a CeraVe foaming gentle cleanser months and months ago and immediately stopped because I realized my ""suddenly I feel and look really ugly and my face looks terrible for some reason?"" was just my face puffing up directly after using the cleanser.

I stopped using it, and have since tried a korean oil cleanser and a la roche posay cleanser, both which didn't puff my face up. But I went to see a dermatologist the other day because my acne has not improved at all despite tons of treatment attempts and among differin and a prescription spot treatment cream, he told me to get a Cetaphil gentle cleanser for sensitive skin.

SkincareAddiction,[Personal] I was surprised by this today. ,"So I was looking to upgrade my current routine a little bit by trying my first chemical exfoliation. In the past I was into mechanical exfoliation but it wasn't doing much for my dry patches and flakes. I was hesitant as I have sensitive skin and this will be an acid but I did some Googling and it was suggested that PHA's were perfect for dry sensitive skin people. So I was on the hunt. I was gonna get a PHA exfoliant. To my surprise however, there wasn't a lot of options. In fact, when I asked for a PHA exfoliant, there was difficulty finding such a product or any PHA product that wasn't mixed with AHA. All I saw was AHA and BHA and AHA with BHA and AHA is too strong for my sensitive skin so I stay far away from it and I don't have oily skin so BHA seems not right for my skin. I finally found something which was Aveeno PHA exfoliant so I took it. It was the only thing they had. I just couldn't believe that PHA wasn't in the spotlight more. Idk. I felt an under representation moment for us sensitive dry folks.  AHA is the star. I hope one day PHA gets its time to shine more and we can try different chemical exfoliants that are safe for us.

SkincareAddiction,[Acne] How do you know when you should get a returning acne cyst removed VS left alone?,"I posted about my acne cyst in this sub a few days ago & got SO many helpful suggestions, but my post was taken down :/ Anyways, I have a MASSIVE acne cyst on my cheek that has been there for over a month now. Got it injected twice and it’s still very much there. 

I am going to go to the derm again anyway, so he will give me a course of action, but what are the signs a cyst should be removed vs left alone or injected? 

Many people say a cyst will keep returning if the sac is not removed — but why do so many people have cysts successfully injected, making them go away in a matter of days? I have had hormonal / cystic pimples and they all eventually go away on their own. Why isn’t this one? And why isn’t my cyst responding well to injections?

I will say the second round of injections flattened it a lot, but I am afraid it won’t go away because its still a bit inflamed and i can still very much feel it under my skin.

SkincareAddiction,[Misc] Sudden hyperpigmentation (PIH),"Hi all!

I've really struggling with my skin lately and hoping someone might have some advice/experience to share.

For the past 6/7 months I've been having more breakouts than usual and they're leaving dark spots behind. Before this, my skin was pretty clear, with the odd pimple here and there around my period, and I never really had any hyperpigmentation left behind.

I haven't changed my skincare routine in the past few months so I have no clue what could be the cause for this sudden increase in pimples and hyperpigmentation.

I've been using Cos de Baha's tranexamic acid serum to help fade the marks and I think it is, but its a bit slow.

Please let me know if you have any thoughts! More looking for thoughts on why the sudden change as I already know there's loads of posts on how to deal with PIH. 

Is it just my skin changing as I get older (i'm only 23 😭)?

SkincareAddiction,[product question] Salicylic Acid Purge,"SALICYLIC ACID PURGE

Hi everyone I recently started using “equate beauty blackhead clearing scrub” which is a 2% salicylic acid ingredient. I’m in week 2 of using it once a week and I believe I am purging. I’m not to sure if it’s purging or just irritation. I’ve been breaking out in my chin area. A lot I’m not to sure if this is a purging signal since correct me if I am wrong, but only retinol and retionds make an individual break out? 

Please let me know if you guys think I should continue using this product till like a month and see how it goes or just quit it?

The breakouts are very small and not that large YET

Background history :
About a month ago I also started using 1% trentiod but stopped because of certain issues. So now I’m using this product once a week , can the breakout that are coming out be from the tren and the salicylic acid is just getting rid of those extra things?

SkincareAddiction,Advice with Routine Needed! [Routine Help],"The routine shown below shows the products that I use every day.

For context, I normally have dry skin, and I've been using this specific routine for 3-4 weeks now (after removing Anua 10% Niacinamide+ 4% Tranexamic Acid Serum and COSRX Snail Mucin Moisturizer Cream) and my biggest concern right now is that my acne is still not going away with a couple of new bumps occasionally forming (Whitehead type). I have a few questions to see if I should keep running with this routine.

1. I'm using a specific daily acne cleanser from SOME BY MI, which has AHA, BHA, and PHA as actives. I've been told that these actives shouldn't be used every day. However, this is considered to be a daily cleanser, so I use it every day anyways. I don't necessarily notice dry or flaky skin. I think I should still use this every day, but what do you guys think?
2. Going back to the SOME BY MI acne cleanser, is this okay to combine this with the retinol that I'm using? It has 0.1% (10,000 ppm) retinol. Or should I get another cleanser for nighttime without the AHA and BHA actives so I can keep using my retinol at night?
3. Overall, what changes should be made with this routine? I'm hoping the acne I have right now is purging skin but I could be wrong and I want to make sure this routine works for me. I think the biggest mistake I did was introduce too many products at once without doing enough research (even though I've done a lot initially).

SkincareAddiction,[Personal]I might have burned my skin from azaelic acid 20%,"I've been using 20% AA (upgraded from 10% AA)for about 3 months now every night. It stings on application but eventually goes away after 20 minutes. I've been noticing some redness in various areas of my face and it's quite apparent. This just popped up recently too. I went through a crazy purge during the first month so I'm not sure if it's the pigmentation from the previous pimples that came up or something else.

I'm afraid to stop using it now since I'm too deep into it that I might be ruining progress. I'm also afraid of what these red areas will look like once they're healed. Initially I started AA to deal with acne and hyperpigmentation. If I'm being honest, I'm not sure if its even working at all. All I know is that stings on application.

SkincareAddiction,[Product request] [routine help] Tretinoin has less effects then non-prescription serums on me,"Hello everyone, came to ask for your expert opinion. I used the Ordinary Granactive Retinoid 2% Emulsion for as long as I can remember, I'm guessing 5+ years. In the meantime I tried other retinol products but always came back to this one because I have very pale/porcelain skin with cool undertones, and the ordinary one gives me this silvery glow especially visible in the inner corners of my eyes and undereyes, and I just love the combination. I can't say I've seen other benefits like skin tightening or any effect on fine lines.

About a half a year ago, I started using prescriprion tretinoin instead - I'm at 0,25% every other day for a few months already, and had two fraxel dual treatments in between  (I wasnt using tretioin for a few days before and a week after). Apart from the fact that I don't see any difference from the fraxel, I also don't see any difference which could be attributed to tretinoin. I'm only guessing that it is doing something because when I started, it came with a lot of peeling in the first month.

In your experience, does it take longer for tretinoin benefits to kick in, and does it give you a visible glow?
Have you come accross any alternatives that would be stronger than the ordinary emulsion to work the fine lines, but also gave you a glow like that?

 I'm contemplating going back to the serum, but also don't want to give up on the long term benefits of tretinoin (which should be more significant based on anything I read about it) just to get that little silvery area back.

SkincareAddiction,Mole removal [MISC],"Dermatologists and Plastic Surgeon Mole Removal 

A family member of mine has had a few of their seemingly benign moles removed for cosmetic reasons, and the pathology actually came back cancerous. Not melanoma, but still of a cancerous type and/or precancerous. Especially since I have had a few moles grow back weirdly after laser mole removal, I would like to have some of my darker, bigger moles removed just for precaution. 

The issue is the dermatologist is telling me they are likely fine and don’t want to biopsy anything or refer me to a plastic surgeon. And the plastic surgeons I’ve consulted with are telling me they don’t want to remove it without a derm saying it looks suspicious and needs to be taken out. 

It’s left me a bit concerned. I see all the time Reddit posts by derms saying that they would rather be safe than sorry, how this one mole looked benign but turns out wasn’t. But it seems like in my experience, they don’t seem to really want to be proactive about it? Maybe I’m just overly paranoid due to my family history and the fact that I care about skincare, sun care etc. 

But anyone have input or any recommendations for getting moles removed (not with laser bc that can cause issue for skin cancer detection later on) as a precaution? ",1cozfd1
SkincareAddiction,[Acne] Is this purging from Azaleic Acid?,"Hey I'm pretty new to this but also desperate for help. My derm told me they can't see me until July (this was February..)

Pretty much last Feb 2023 I started getting neck acne (brand new to me, well versed with face acne that is kept at bay with CeraVe Foaming Cleanser, BPO, Aveeno Calm + Restore in AM, Azaleic acid + CeraVe nighttime moisturizer). Has been for years, occasionally few zits around my period.

I ended up having to go on spironolactone to clear the acne, that with a nightly 4% BPO wash (PanOxyl), and topical Clindamycin lotion. It was clear (enough) from September-January

Long-story short, we were trying to get pregnant so I came off spironolactone in December, got pregnant in March and now my neck is on a rampage.

Recent steps:

* I broke out in February after being off spironolactone for about 2 months, was still on topical BPO + Clindamycin at this point
* My derm told me to add in AZA 15%, so I did but it was too irritating to have that in combination. So I tried alternating, backing off of the AZA or the BPO, and in mid-April it got to the point where I just had to take a week off of everything because the barrier was so bad. When I got pregnant I had to stop the Clindamycin.

The first photo is just after finishing that week in April (I think throughout the week the acne got worse, maybe it was going to happen anyways with the pregnancy). The second photo is today, so after being on the once daily AZA for about 2 weeks. My current regimen has been topical AZA in the morning, followed by a moisturizer. I tried doing the BPO at night again but stopped it about 4 or 5 days ago because my skin was too irritated all the time. I am now trying to do AZA every other day.

Is this purging? It feels fine now, it wasn't stinging or hurting or anything when I put on my topicals, which hasn't happened for a few days. I feel so defeated.

SkincareAddiction,[Sun care] Even mineral sunscreen bothers my eyes,"Hello everyone! I've been wanting to wear sunscreen more often, especially on my face, because I've heard it is one of the best things you can do in terms of anti-aging. The problem is, sunscreen does NOT get along with me at all for many reasons, but the worst of which is that it bothers my eyes. I have both a mineral and a chemical sunscreen and they both cause problems. I read online that you should choose mineral sunscreen if your eyes are itching or burning, but this hasn't helped. I use a 50 SPF coppertone face sunscreen that is 100% mineral and free of parabens, dyes, fragrance, oxybenzone, octinoxate, and PABA (whatever that is). Id doesnt bother my eyes, but by the end of the day my eyes feel so irritated and itchy, and they *only* get like that on the days I wear sunscreen. 

The other things I have been hating about sunscreen are that it is mega greasy and it *smells* like sunscreen (I cant stand the smell, if I'm being honest). I just do not know what to do! If anyone has any product recommendations or tips for how I can keep my sunscreen from bothering my eyes, I would be immensely grateful. Please keep in mind, though, that I am broke as hell so I really cant afford anything outside of drugstore pricing. $30 for 1.7 ounces of sunscreen is never gonna work for me.

SkincareAddiction,[Acne] Antibiotic Resistance?,"
So for a while (1+ yrs) I have been on a curology subscription that contains clindamycin, and It genuinely helped me a lot. However over the last few months I’ve been experiencing really bad breakouts with multiple different types of acne in multiple areas of my face. I think where I went wrong was not updating my progress photos on the website, and so the prescription has stayed the same the whole time, and I’m worried that because of this I’ve developed bacteria that are resistant to the treatment. So I’ve just reached out to curology and now I’m waiting to hear back from them.

So the question I guess is if I stop the medication now is there a chance that my face will dramatically get worse than it already is now? 
My subscription also includes Azelaic acid and niacinamide, both of which I think have been good for me, so if I just switch to OTC products with those ingredients would that help to mitigate any further damage to my skin?",1cp68eo

WomensHealth,Endometrial Ablation Experience,"Hi everyone,

I (35F) had surgery on April 19, endometrial ablation, fibroid removal and tubes removed. I am anemic due to heavy menstrual bleeding and was given an iron transfusion before surgery. A few days after surgery my period started when it should but was pretty light and I was so excited thinking this would be the new normal. It has now been 2.5 weeks of bleeding and since Wednesday it was been super heavy like it was before surgery. 
I ended up going to the ER yesterday because I was going through Ultra tampons every 30-40mins. My blood work came back normal (seems like that transfusion really helped my iron levels) so all they could really do is prescribe me Tranexamic Acid and send me on my way. I’ve been taking it since last night (bedtime, morning, midday, and just now) and I’m still bleeding through ultras in about 2-3hrs.
Has anyone had major bleeding after their ablation? Is this an unfortunate normal for the first few months? Or sign that surgery didn’t work?

WomensHealth,Opposite effects quitting birth control ? ,"Hello, is there anybody out there? Feeling like an alien. 

I started birth control when I was about 20 years old until I turned 33. I quit cold turkey because I met my fiance and we decided we wanted the possibility of offspring. Before I went on birth control my periods were horrendously heavy, I had terrible skin, and extreme emotional hardships every cycle. I also had so much pain the first day or two of my cycle I couldn't function.

I've read a lot about how birth control can lower your libido and cause a lot of issues. I seem to have the opposite effect because I've been having those symptoms since quitting birth control. When I was on the pill my skin cleared up and looked full and fresh. I was also more sensual and had a higher libido. My tits filled out and my body toned really well from exercise. Even the year before I quit taking the pills. I felt more motivated and energized in general. I stopped taking it for the first time about a year and a half ago. I immediately gained 15/20 lbs (highest I've ever weighed) and bloated almost like water weight. It took a few months to slim back to my normal body weight and my chest shrunk too. Slowly over the past year especially, my skin has acquired cystic acne around my jaw. I spot the week before my period, which may or may not be heavy now. It's definitely not as bad as it used to be, but the mood swing and depression is. So for half the month I feel out of commission. Also I have like a negative libido, and sometimes I feel dry down there. My hair has thinned out and basically I just feel like a s*** version of myself. 

I'm only 34 but I feel as if I'm going through some kind of menopause with jacked up periods or my hormones are really out of whack. I'm a relatively healthy sober and active person. But quitting birth control has made me feel like I aged 20 years. Has anyone else had this kind of opposite reaction? I know birth control isn't exactly healthy for a few serious reasons. I'm just wondering if this is normal or if I should go back on the birth control. Women's health feels so dystopian to this day.

Now I'm googling and it seems these levels are indeed too low for a premenopausal woman?

For reference, some of the issues that made me concerned are completely absent sex drive, non-existent lubrication which makes sex very uncomfortable when I do have it, irregular cycle with frequently missing periods or period delayed by weeks, and honestly even the way my body has developed (my chest is almost entirely flat, I have thin, brittle hair and a childish appearance overall.)

Got a question with regard to the seriousness of endometrial polyps. 31F here and I've always had heavy and painful periods, but they got kind of heavier recently so I saw my physician who suggested an ultrasound. The ultrasound found something which they said could be an endometrial polyp (0.8 cm in size) and my physician thinks it could be the cause of heavy bleeding. Physician referred me to an obgyn.  Never had this before and worried.

Now the issue is, this happened last month and my the earliest obgyn appt I could get was for mid June. My insurance will change starting July 1 (I'm in the US) so I might need to change obgyns after that June appointment. So I'm wondering how serious this is, and if it's worth going to the June appointment at all since I'd have to find a new obgyn anyway for subsequent appointments.

WomensHealth,Guidance re: Abnormal Pap,"This might be long, so I apologize in advance. I'm hoping that I can get some guidance or positive feedback from members of this group regarding the next steps after having an abnormal pap.

Some background:

I'm 37, married, never had children and don't intend to have children. I live in Washington State. I was diagnosed with PCOS in my early 20s and therefore have been on birth control for most of my adult life in order to have a regular period. I take supplements daily as well to manage PCOS symptoms.

When I was 22 I had an abnormal pap and had my first colposcopy. It was excruciating. One of the biopsy sites continued to bleed to the point where I woke up in a pool of blood that night. I took myself to the ER only to have an ER doctor tell me, ""Well, I can't see your cervix because there's a clot."" He then sent me home. The next morning I was in agonizing pain and my mom told me to go to the walk-in clinic. The sweet doctor there removed the clot and was astonished that the ER doctor sent me home. I was fairly traumatized after that experience.

I moved Central Washington when I was 26. At 27 I had another abnormal pap. Had to have another colposcopy. It was also excruciating. I was bawling on the table. I vowed to never see that same OBGYN again due to her lack of empathy and general dismissal of my pain. Since then I have only had my annuals done with my GP. They have been normal.

However, last week I had an annual and the results came back again as abnormal. Specifically, ""Atypical Squamous Cells, cannot exclude High Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion - No HPV"".

My GP sent me to OB for a consult and sadly, the only doctor that was available was the same OB that I vowed to never see again. Today was just a consult for a colposcopy. I told her how there was no way that I could stand another biopsy without being sedated. She said the best they can do is give me an anti-anxiety and one pain pill. IV sedation is not something they offer and in her words, ""I don't know anywhere that offers that for a colposcopy."" I told her that I thought it was archaic that you can get IV sedated when you have your wisdom teeth out, but not when chunks of your cervix are being removed. It wasn't a great consult. I cried. She stared at me uncomfortably as I cried. She said that in the past, my abnormal results were ""low grade"" and resolved themselves, but she was concerned about the lack of HPV and that although she's seen this result occasionally, they want a biopsy done immediately to rule out pre-cancer or cancer. She tried to make me feel better by saying that if they come back pre-cancer or cancer, I would be IV sedated with a LEEP procedure. Not sure that makes me feel better.

I think I should also note that I asked my GP to test my cortisol levels at my last appointment with her. They came back high, so I have to go and have a dexamethasone suppression test in two weeks. When I read more about high cortisol levels, I spiraled thinking I might have Cushing's Syndrome or Disease. Just as I was acclimating to this news, I get the news for the abnormal pap. Needless to say, I'm having a difficult time. I've always been fairly healthy and this is all kind of scary.

I'm so frustrated. Not only by the lack of pain management, but by feeling ignored and dismissed. So I guess I'm wondering:

* Has anyone had a similar reaction to having a colposcopy? If so, did anti-anxiety and pain meds help with the procedure.
* If you live in Washington State, have you heard of sedation for a colposcopy, if so where?
* Has anyone had similar abnormal pap results? Did you need to have a LEEP?

Update: I think I've decided that I need to see a new OBGYN, rather than the one I saw today. I just looked at my chart notes and she completely ignored the fact that I told her Xanax doesn't work for me and has it in my notes that she's prescribing .05mg of Xanax before the procedure. That's not going to do anything. So logically, I need to find someone who will actually listen to me. This sucks.",1cotp4b
WomensHealth,Never-Ending Period After Stopping Acne Oral Medicine?,"I started taking 100mg Spironolactone (oral acne medicine) on January 5th 2024. The day after, I got my period for the first time in 3 years (have been on birth control for 8 years, but lost significant weight 3 years ago after being very overweight). The periods occurred every 2 weeks lasting for 4 days each. I lowered my dosage to 50mg after I started gaining weight on the Spironolactone a few weeks in - the periods continued. 

After gaining almost 15 pounds in two months, I had enough and stopped taking Spironolactone after talking to my doctor. I stopped taking the medicine on March 2nd, and on March 3rd I started a period that lasted until March 17. I then spotted lightly on March 28 and April 10. Then on April 18, I started a period that lasted until May 1. It went away for a few days then came back on May 7 and hasn’t stopped since. 

I’m really struggling here - going from no periods to basically a never ending period has been mentally draining. It has been affecting me so much - I constantly worry about bleeding through/it’s affecting my sex life/it’s affecting my whole life.

**I wanted to know if anyone else has gotten non-stop periods? Could this be happening to me for another reason other than the medicine?** The periods have gotten so much worse since I got off, but I just can’t get back on it - the weight gain really ruined the first half of 2024 for me, and. I’m just now starting to lose some of the weight after really trying.

Edit:

I’m 25, 5’11, and currently 159 pounds. In the three years before the medicine, I was 150 pounds. I work out for at least 30 minutes a day (pilates and biking) and I do a megaformer class once a week. I have been on Norlyda birth control for over 8 years. I lost my period 3 years ago after losing 80 pounds. I eat well (lots of proteins and veggies) and drink socially. I do not do any drugs, but do use an e-cigarette. ",1cowjdd
WomensHealth,Vaginal Atrophy ,"Ok Ladies, let’s talk vaginal atrophy haha. I had a complete hysterectomy and oophorectomy at 38, which put me into surgical menopause. That was 6 years ago. This week I had some spotting, scared me. Went to gyno today and was told I have vaginal atrophy. I’m not sure how I feel about this, kinda sad.

WomensHealth,Boob pains?,"I’ve been on Birth control for three months so far and when i first started birth control i had boob pains that were sensitive to temperature change, but then went away after two weeks- well ever since i started the beginning of my 3rd months packet, my boobs have been aching and it’s mainly my nipple area. It’s a mixture of soreness and a little bit of sharpness if i put pressure on my nipples,esp laying down. It’s gotten better a bit since i stopped wearing a wired bra, but it still hurts when i lay on my stomach or put pressure on my nipple or under boob area(i have DDD’s). I do notice my boobs do feel a bit tender too, but like i said again- no lumps.
It’s been 13 days (im on my second week of my packet) 
Does this seem normal? I’ve never had boob pains this severe until i started taking birth control for health reasons (i didnt have a period for three years). So i just need an idea to see if if others have had similar issues before consulting with mh parents about talking to a doctor.

WomensHealth,Colposcopy ,I have to get a colposcopy for an abnormal Pap smear. My doctor told me to avoid intercourse for 2 weeks prior but everything I have read says 2 days prior? Is it to prevent risk of pregnancy that she told me 2 weeks?  Anyone have information on this? ,1cosogz
WomensHealth,PMS help!!,"A little background on me- I was on hormonal BC (Ortho TriCyclen) from age 14 (for my acne and incredibly painful periods) or so until college. In college I switched to NuvaRing for a time, but it made me absolutely crazy so I switched back to oral contraception. Stayed on that until I got married at 21, got pregnant at age 22, then used Nexplanon between pregnancies so I could continue breastfeeding. I've only been off hormonal BC for a few years now (since my husband got the snip) and it feels like just the last year or so that I've really gotten to know what my actual, non-medicated, non-pregnant or nursing cycle is like. 

So now on to the actual question I have: what on earth do you all do for PMS symptoms? I don't even care much about the physical things, but the moodiness is REAL. I genuinely question my sanity in the week-ten days before my period. I'm irritable, sad, anxious, you name it. This is new to me in the last year/year and a half. I tried FLO vitamins, and another no-name gummy supplement, and neither have had any real impact. I'm even entertaining the idea of going back on oral BC. I'm only hesitating because I really love the other parts of my cycle and I don't necessarily want to level those out. 

Lay it on me- what do you use that works? Herbal supplements, BC, something else I don't know about?",1coruck
WomensHealth,Bleeding outside of periods. Doctor suspects endometriosis and suggested getting a hormone-releasing IUD (Mirena). Should I do it?,"Hi there. I am 19 and have had my periods since I was 12 but for the last 2 years I also had stuff like bloody discharge during ovulation week. The few times I brought it up to gynos before, they said it is normal to be a bit bloody during ovulation, so I brushed it off. 

The last 3-4 months this bleeding expanded outside of ovulation and became almost constant, so I would end up bleeding/have bloody discharge for about 25 days a month (instead of just 5 during menstruation). The last period also came 2 weeks late and before that I had a meaty chunk fall out of me, which really threw me off. 

I had a gyno appointment this week and the doctor said that he didn't find any abnormalities during the ultrasound or physical checkup. My pap smear and STD test results are also fine. He said it is most probably endometriosis, because it might not always show on scans, but the symptoms are similar.

He suggested that to treat the ""bleeding all the time"" issue I could get a hormone-releasing IUD (Mirena). He also said that I can get a BC pill, but that would release hormones into my whole body, whereas the IUD would mostly only target the uterus, so it wouldn't cause that big of side effects. He made sure to clarify, that it might not work for me, since every body reacts differently and there's a chance it won't help with the problem or might even make it worse. 

I am just generally iffy about getting on hormonal BC, because I am afraid how it might affect my mood, mental health and weight. Plus I know that it is not scientifically proven but some cases made me fear it might cause infertility. On top of that, IUD insertion is very painful, and can damage the cervix or uterus or other organs there. He told me that it is obviously down to me and I will be able to have it removed the next day if I wanted to, but to see any results, it would take about 3-6 period cycles to notice any significant changes. 

Is there anyone who has had a similar issue and got IUD as a form of treatment? Could you please share your experience, I would really appreciate it.",1cooy6l
WomensHealth,"Supplements, and overall health","I’ve (38) never been good or consistent with taking vitamins and supplements. But as the last 5-6 years have gone by and my body has changed (weight gain, pre menopausal, ovarian failure) I’ve been more inclined to use them.

My diet isn’t the worst but it’s not the best either, so I sometimes will take/drink Amazing Grass Greens blend.

I came across a video for collagen. Googled it, did some light research, found one on Amazon that had good ratings. So sometimes I throw a scoop of that into my coffee.

I also have on my shelf one a day women’s daily multivitamin, vitamins C and D, elderberry gummies and  now Align pre and probiotic for women.

Again, I DO NOT take all of these at once or on a consistent basis. Frankly I don’t even know what I’m doing when it comes to supplements.  I just know I’m tired of taking drugs. I want something “natural”.  

With my supplements collection growing it dawned on me that this is something I don’t hear often about for women’s health.  All I ever hear and or see are ads for weight loss and how to fit into the teeny eeny bikini. Or take this pill it will cure what ales you. 

What are you ladies taking or doing for yourselves that doesn’t fuel the drug industry?

What are your feelings towards natural balancing hormone supplements/teas/etc?

What are your experiences? Were expectations met? 

Hope this finds you well. I look forward to hearing your story.  TIA for your time.

WomensHealth,Nonstop bleeding on pill ,"I started the combination pill last month to help with extremely heavy periods and PMDD. I am supposed to be on continuous cycle. I started bleeding 11 days ago and it's not stopped. It's like a heavy period with cramps and backache. 

I tried talking to the NP who prescribed it, but my messages were answered by a nurse and I felt dismissed yet again. I mentioned it was heavy and constant for 10 days at the point, and she just said that can happen and to see a clinician if I'm concerned. I thought by contacting the person who prescribed the pill that that's what ai was doing.  

I expected a bit better, given the info I found online said if the bleeding lasts more than a week, is heavy or accompanied by a lot of pain to contact a medical provider, and I was just brushed off. 

I don't know whether to keep going or to give up. This is what happened last time I tried birth control but it was a long time ago, so I had hoped it would be different. ",1con7h9

I'm 27 and never had sex before. I'd read other people's experience and it doesn't appear that being sexually active significantly reduces the amount of pain you experience because at most, people just said it was uncomfortable or itchy. However for me, when my doctor inserted the speculum and started getting it in deeper, he kept telling me to relax and take deep breaths but despite trying all of that I was in so much pain. Literally howling ""Ows"" and ""Oohs"" and squeezing my hands because of how bad it was. It was so unbearable I asked my doctor to pull it out. Took 15 secs and just wanted to get it over with so he had to insert a new speculum and it was still so painful. My doctor said I was already using the smallest device so I don't think it was an issue with size. I eventually just had to bear with the pain to get it over with, but I could not stop howling until the device was removed.

Honestly, this experience was so bad, it's making me terrified of having sex in the future. I am honestly put off from ever wanting to get a pap smear done too.

WomensHealth,I think I have PCOS but I’m not sure. Help,"Hey! So I am looking for help because I think I have PCOS or endo and I’m not really sure because I feel like my doctors have been gaslighting me my entire life. 

For some background: I am 27 years old and I had a hysterectomy when I was 25 years old which adds to the it’s hard to really be able to bring this up with a doctor. 
However I have always had severe period symptoms like absolutely debilitating. Before my hysterectomy my periods were always irregular and I only for half of the ones that women get typically (I was more of a bimonthly period and not a monthly. 

My cramps have always been so bad that it hurts to even stand as the pain would radiate from my lower stomach all the down to my feet and cause my entire lower body to throb with pain. I get nauseated, I have stomach issues, I’m exhausted, my cramps are really bad, like sitting on the floor in the store deep breathing and giving myself a pep talk to get up bad, and any kinda of sexual activity with anyone that included penetration has always caused agony and not pleasure in the slightest. 

When I was about 18 I asked a doctor about my cycles and mentioned they were both irregular and bad and he told me if I was getting them at all I was fine. That was the end of that discussion. It’s actually been the end of the discussion anytime I’ve brought it up. 

I got my uterus taken out for gender affirming surgery as I was identifying as a trans man at the time and I was actually really excited about the no periods thing. 
Flash to two years later, I’ve been off of t for iver a year and for the most part the changes that happened to me while on t have gone back to normal. I feel a little lied to that I wouldn’t have periods anymore. I still very much do I simply don’t bleed. I got my uterus removed but not ovaries. 
I’ve began tracking when I have the symptoms I have to see if they happen consistently at the same time every month. They do. I’ve tracked them now for three months. 
The symptoms are horrible cramps that knock the wind out of me,fatigue, gastrointestinal issues, back aches, feeling like I’m going to throw up constantly, I get more depressed and anxious  than usual, etc. 
aside from that of all the things that went away once off of testosterone the one thing I cannot seem to get rid of is random hairs on my chin, upper lip, or just random singular hairs or two on a cheek. I shave them with a face razor, they’re back two days later. 

I really want to bring this up to my OB and ask how one gets tested for Pcos and if I can. I know there isn’t much they can do about it but it would be nice to know. Side notes that my breasts are full of chats and so I don’t think it is too far fetched to wonder if my ovaries are as well.

WomensHealth,What problem have you had dismissed because you’re a woman?,"My doctor dismissed my depressive symptoms as PMS today.

Today I finally rang the doctors after a long three years of struggling on and off with my low mood, persistent crying, anxiety and stress. 
Over the past couple of months I have reached breaking point, it has had an effect on my relationship and my work life. I was really hoping for some blood work to see if a hormonal imbalance was the cause of this depression or something else.
I was denied a hormonal test and this led to my doctor asking a bunch of personal questions and making me feel like I’m just a silly woman with a bit of PMS. 
I now have to document my cycle over the next two months even though I know that my mood has little correlation with my cycle and I’m feeling down most days whether I’m expecting my period or not.

WomensHealth,Out of Options for My Pelvic Floor,"Just wanted to share my frustrating experience with you guys. I have overactive bladder, interstitial cystitis, chronic constipation and severe pelvic floor dysfunction.

Info: I'm 21 years old, with my symptoms becoming problematic at 18. (I say problematic because I've always had to pee but never thought about it being a medical condition until I got interstitial cystitis and worsened overactive bladder.) I have no children and am a virgin.

My Bladder: My pain started with a very bad UTI that had me peeing blood within 2hrs of symptoms. I went to the doctor within 32hrs. From then on, I had to pee around 32 times a day, including 8-12 times at night. I also had UTI symptoms constantly and was suddenly sensitive to nearly everything I ate. I couldn't be in a car for more than 15 minutes without pain because my bladder would fill up immediately if I got in a car. I had to dehydrate myself to do anything. I was in pain for almost a year before I saw a doctor because my dad wanted me to see one. My urologists delayed my diagnoses because they believed my issues were temporary and prescribed a short term medication that I had to take for 3 years. This medication is linked to dementia and I swear my memory is a little off these days. My insurance denied the other medication options because there aren't generics. My urologist said there was nothing else they could do. I switched to a urogynecologist who is amazing, and laughed at my urologists. She prescribed me a new medication right away and I am happy to take it indefinitely considering my health. My urologist also never examined me. They only performed ultrasounds and urinalysis.

Physical Therapy: My original urologist sent me to physical therapy. That physical therapist never examined me and told me to do kegels non stop and that my muscles must be weak. I failed out and she sent me somewhere else. I saw a new physical therapist who was amazing, and actually is the one who referred me to my urogynecologist. She examined me and was shocked by how tense my muscles are. She said kegels are the last thing I should be doing. I've had minimal improvement from physical therapy after a year. I have no flexibility, trust me I've tried. Half of the stretches she recommended, I was already doing. I have a pelvic wand and dilators. I failed out and was discharged for lack of improvement because insurance only covers physical therapy if you're improving.

My pelvic floor: My entire pelvis is tense. (Though my entire body is actually tense.) I can't feel the tension or pain most of the time. My urogyn said I should be in more pain than I'm describing. My muscles constantly spasm but I usually can't feel them unless I touch them. There are really painful spots when I use my pelvic wand. I also can barely fit two fingers in my vagina. My urogyn says my 6 o'clock muscles are really bad. My worst muscle is at 12 o'clock, which cannot be treated with physical therapy. This muscle does not bend, stretch or move. It feels like bone and any doctor or physical therapist is shocked when I point it out. This muscle can actually make my tampons get stuck. 

Trigger Point Injections: I recieved several trigger point injections, including pudendal nerve blocks. I got the max amount of steroid, including directly into my worst muscle. These injections did nothing. Except cause over a $1,200 bill when I was quoted around $400. I had them done in the OR by my doctor's advice. They did my first pap smear while in there because my doctor could not find my cervix at the last appointment.

At my checkup, my doctors were shocked that the injections did not work. They said I could try suppositories that are not covered by insurance and only last 5hrs. Otherwise there are no other options. There isn't anything else for me to try and my pelvis is stuck like this. I can continue with my pelvic wand but there isn't much hope and it's very disappointing. I don't know if anyone is experiencing something similar but this is my experience.",1cod23d

Also if I have to buckle my seat belt in the passenger side I have to get someone else to do it. Furthermore if I'm grabbing something from the drive thru like a lot of food for people or something when I turn my body to reach out the window to get it the pain happens then too. Sometimes I have to hold the side of my stomach or just sit normally for pain to subside. I'm a 39 year old male. Don't drink alcohol dont do drugs nor smoke. I am over weight at 275.

",1cp2fd2
menshealth,28 y.o. Testicular discomfort and Abdominal Bloating - Dr(s). Can't figure it out ,"My history: I am 28. A few months ago I started getting a burning feeling in my testicular region. The sack was hot to the touch and mainly hurt when the balls drooped lower (from the heat). Compression shorts and ice helped a ton. The Dr. did a urine test, which showed nothing. Based on my symptoms, she said I likely had Epididymitis, and prescribed me with Doxy. Took the 10 day cycle, but it wasn't really until Day 8 that the pain was completely gone.

A few days after the prescription expired, the pain came back. But this time, it was accompanied by substantial bloating in my abs, and let me tell you, my gas smelled like something I've never smelt before. I usually find smelly gas funny, but not this stuff. It could clear a room and make you sick.

Saw a urologist and he said that it is highly unlikely my Epididymitis could have came back and said the Ab pain and testicular pain are not related. He said he did feel a few hydroceles, but wanted an Ultrasound to confirm. Did that, and everything came back PERFECT.

So I saw a GI, who did an at home stool test. Again, everything came back fine. I'm currently fighting with my Dr. to let me do a colonoscopy (mainly for peace of mind). My grandpa had colon cancer and my dad has polyps. And I occasionally have blood in my stool. However, my great grandpa, grandpa, dad, and myself, all have had this problem on occasion, and the Dr. has told them it is due to weak veins in that area, which are easily busted with any straining. Because of this, she will not give me a colonoscopy. She said ""since you dad is having them done, he is going the work for you. If he develops colon cancer, I will test you"".

Look, I have no idea if a colon issue is causing this. But I'm getting pretty agitated that I am having this pain and it is undiagnosable.

Is it excruciating pain? No. My life is the same as it was before. But mentally I know there is something not right.

For those that may have similar experiences, here is my full list of symptoms:

* Balls feel heavy when they are hot. Almost feels like a weight is hanging from me
* Sometimes pain radiates down inner leg
* Pressure above my penis.
* Bad bloating. It doesn't hurt on its own, but it embarrasses me with how fat it makes me look, so I suck it in some, causing pain
* Occasional blood in stool (since I was a baby)
* Pain goes away when laying down.
* Compression shorts and Ice completely relieve ball pain
* No pain with ejaculation
* No burning when peeing, but the pressure above my penis gives discomfort. Hard to explain. Kind of hurts slightly when I abruptly cut off my stream.
* Negative for Gonorrhea and Chlamydia   

I have seen on the internet that epididymitis can have some ""after effects"", such as the formation of hydroceles and/or Varicocele's. But ultrasound was fine.

Another note: I live in SE Ohio, which was heavily effected by the DuPont C8 crisis during my young age. If you don't know what I'm talking about, google it. GI, Colon, and Testicular issues were the main symptoms from the pollution. I told my Dr. that and she said ""wow, I'm not from here. I had no idea"". This is how I actually convinced her to do the stool test.",1coquop

When the issue started becoming more of an issue, I communicated it to her, and she has been great with it all. 

I've now finished uni, so that stress and anxiety have gone, but the problem persists. 

When my body does behave properly, I’m now getting performance anxiety, which is starting to affect my mental health. I've only recently finished uni; I don't know if I should wait a bit longer to see if it resolves or go to the doctor. 

I don't have issues getting erections, but when I want to be intimate with my wife, I get issues (performance anxiety).

Right now I’m in my longest sexual dry spell. It’s been 6 months and counting. I can feel my body responding to it too. I’m horny a lot. My muscles feel tense. And my brain feels crazy, somewhat like a bad high. I’m usually pretty confident with girls. But I’m kinda losing it because girls that I used to sleep with are now starting to sleep with my friends. Which I’m not particularly mad at (Eskimo brotherhood is fun), but I’m kinda wondering “god damn dude what are you doing wrong?”

For those out there that have been here before- what did you do? I masturbate once a day usually, which isn’t helping like I thought it would. Any advice on how to help break this?

menshealth,I think we need to change the type of bodies that are promoted for men in the Health and Fitness Industry.,"As a grown male adult, I am inundated (especially online) with Men's Health and Fitness related advertisements, articles, studies, blogs, etc., and the majority of the time the male bodies that are used to depict ""health and fitness"" seem more akin to bodybuilding physiques with PEDs.   


I recently saw a contest pop up on Facebook for a competition, and Mr.HealthandFit is doing this contest on who should be the next the next Mr. Health and Fitness. Lots of the guys are obviously juiced and massed up, and I just can't get down with that, as it's not healthy internally on several different levels, even with proper blood work, diet, etc.   


Point being, I think we need to change our perception of what ""healthy and fit"" look like, and bring it closer to a more biologically accurate definition (and appearance).  


That's why I'll be voting for this guy, Vince Varsh, a licensed therapist and professional Muay Thai fighter, who currently rehabilitates kids full time, has kids of his own, and somehow manages to look like a Greek Statue, on top of everything.   


Being in tune with ones' body, mind, diet, and behaviors that are conducive to achieving the apex of physical fitness, WITHOUT the use of PEDs, should be in my humble opinion, the epitome of fitness and health. And on top of it all, he rehabilitates youth using his martial arts, fitness, and health skills!

I get a horrendous pain that occurs in waves in the middle of my abdomen and lasts for 4-5 hours. I also feel & look very bloated, sometimes vomiting helps sometimes I just need to get through it. The pain can be so severe it’s led me to urgent care more times than I could count at this point. 3 years ago(when I had good health insurance) I had an endoscopy and it was concluded there was no ulcers and was diagnosed with acute gastritis. Fast forward to now, these pains still occur every so often but have been more frequent lately, but more specifically on weekends which is very strange. I’m a 31 yr old healthy male, I exercise 6 days a week, eat really well during the week & try not to eat after 6pm. When I first noticed this weekend pattern, I realized my weekend intake was pretty bad. I would drink hard seltzers, have some junk food with the family so 2 weeks ago I stopped drinking alcohol & over indulging in junk food. Last weekend & this weekend although I’m not getting that severe pain, I’m noticing I’m still waking up with a sour / gurgling stomach and slight diarrhea. The gas and sour feeling tend to go and come, and I’ve noticed my stool has been bloody. My wife thinks it may be hemorrhoids causing the blood as it’s a normal red color not tarry black, but I can’t help but be concerned. My wife also thinks it may be my supplements I take for the gym. Full transparency I take SARMS (Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators) that assist similarly to anabolic steroids, without the heavy dangerous effects. I’m concerned at this point as my symptoms align a bit with those of Colon Cancer. My only hesitation is that I only feel this way on weekends. During the week I have literally zero issues.

Therefore I have become curious about all the various products out there such as pills and gummies that you take either once a day religiously or that you take shortly before having sex in order to reach maximum size and firmness. I know there are men out there who have more serious issues such as full erectile dysfunction. I am a relatively healthy middle-age man. I’m just wondering if any of these supplements such as blue chews or HIMS actually work. Also, are there side effects or anything to worry about taking them?

For background I am 25F. I do not have any form of schooling on my belt aside from high school. That being said I have a HUGE interest in the healthcare field and I have a serious passion for patient advocacy. I’ve been a pharmacy tech for about 5 years now. If I were to do any formal schooling I am at minimum 2-3 years away from being able to do that and that’s if I don’t experience any hardships between now and then.

I really would like to advance my career. The ideal way would be to go to college but I’m not entirely sure if that’s within my capabilities considering the way my life is set up currently. I have been providing for myself since the age of 17. Right now I am making around 42K a year and I am HURTING. Ideally I would like to double that. Most jobs I have seen that above what I am doing right now require a degree. Is there any hope for me being able to make it without a degree? What suggestions would you have? I can’t survive on 42K a year much longer.

Yesterday his front tooth chipped quite badly (almost in half) and he was experiencing 3/10 pain. It looked and felt horrible to him. I took him to a dentist who doesn't accept Medi-Cal but was able to fit him in before closing and paid $460 out of pocket for them to repair his tooth. 

I'm wondering, just out of curiosity - would Medi-Cal be able to reimburse him (me) for the service? I believe chipped teeth are something they cover, and as he wasn't a patient at a participating dentist, he had nowhere to go when his tooth chipped except an emergency dentist.

healthcare,"Thoughts on connecting patient portal health records across multiple charts (Corewell, Trinity, etc.)?","I noticed  many of the US healthcare entities have an option to connect all of your health records so that each entity can see the records all in one place.  Does anyone choose to do this? What are your thoughts on it?

I think it could be beneficial and life-saving to have accessible records across multiple entities in an emergency event. I also have the perspective that if I want a second opinion for anything, it seems it has the potential to be harder to receive if that second opinion has access to all linked notes and records.

My reason for thinking this is because there is something to the patient being able to convey their feelings on what's going on as well without the notes of preceding appointments if those appointments didn't feel like they were on the right track.

I have recognized there are a lot of doctors that will read the notes first instead of giving their impression. I see pros and cons to this. It really depends on the doctor, I know there are doctors that don't let the notes completely dictate their perspectives or impressions, but its going to be likely that an impression can be made from the preceding notes, but could an impression be made more accurate sometimes without the preceding notes and just the doctor's mind at work?

He says he signed me up for Cobra that would last from December 30th 2023 to June 30th 2024. Then he even said that he would be able to get me on his new job’s plan (Horizon) from July 1st to December 31st, 2024.

However, when I called his/my insurance a couple days ago (Aetna) they said my coverage ended on March 31st, 2024. My job gives a period of 30 days after the date of loss of coverage to hop onto their insurance via Life Event Enrollment, and it is now May 4th. The period is over, and it appears I have absolutely zero health insurance until my company’s open enrollment opens up again in November.

My options seem to be to try and somehow get on my company’s plan (probably not happening), see if there is a way I can get Cobra to extend to June 30th like I was originally told it would (not counting on this either) or get a short term health insurance plan myself that lasts from now to November.

Not eligible for ACA as astronomical due to not eligible for any subsidies. Retiree medical is about $400 more than COBRA.

I visited a chiropractor this week who does the first intake session free. The next day, we had our second session where we reviewed my x rays and he suggested an ongoing treatment plan with 3 visits a week in the first  month then 1-2 visits a week after. 

He says the deductible for my insurance is supposed to be $300, and that my insurance covers 70% of each visit. He offered to waive the deductible and said he would accept a $20 copay per visit as opposed to the 30% (apparently, the cost of the 30% and the $20 are about the same)

He told me when the insurance mails the check for the visits, I have to bring it to the office. This will be about twice a month and I signed a paper saying I am aware that my insurance mails checks, and that I will bring him the checks. This seems normal. 

My concern is that he says I’m going to continue seeing the $300 balance for the deductible on my insurance  bill, and that I should just ignore it because he’s waiving it. I asked the front desk person what happens to that balance if I decide to stop treatment, since it will always be on the “expected contribution”. I didn’t really understand their answer.

***My question is: is it normal for a doctor to waive a deductible? If so, what steps can I take to make sure I’m not charged in the future?****

healthcare,At my wit’s end,"Honestly, today just broke me. I don’t have a solution or proposal to fix anything and this post may get ranty but I need somewhere to vent my frustration with the utter insanity the US healthcare system has become.

In the late fall of 2023, I got a letter from my insurance company that the manufacturer of my 3 year old son’s asthma medication was going to stop producing his daily inhaler and that we would need to switch to an alternative. The alternative that was provided for children under 6 years old was not an inhaler but a nebulizer solution (I.e. we would need to buy a several hundred dollar nebulizer machine and he would have to do a daily course of a 15-20 minute nebulized medication compared to the 30 second 2 puff inhaler he had in the past). Obviously this solution was bonkers as getting a 3 year old to sit holding a nebulizer to his face for 1/3 of an hour every night would have been akin to giving a lion a pedicure. 

We filled his inhaler earlier this year just before the cutoff deadline of when our insurance said they would stop covering it and this week was the first time we had to refill it since. I asked our doctor to submit an override authorization, which our insurance promptly denied and referenced the nebulizer alternative. I called my insurer and said what am I supposed to do? I can’t get a toddler to take a daily nebulized medication that he needs to prevent having a potentially devastating asthma attack. They told me “sorry it’s not covered, but if you decide to pay out of pocket for it then the cost will count against your deductible for your high deductible plan at least”. This medication is $320 for a 60 day supply so I went on GoodRX to find a coupon and saw that Walgreens had one for $90. $50 less than any other pharmacy. I called my son’s pediatrician and had them call in the prescription to a Walgreens pharmacy as we gave him the last doses of his previous inhaler today. 

I stopped at the Walgreens after work (and after my son’s doctors office had closed for the day) to pick up the inhaler. I get to the pickup window and the tech informs me that Walgreens does not accept my insurance so the cost of the medication will not count against my deductible. I had no other choice so I silently seethed while I paid for the inhaler that my sons **needs**.

I don’t understand how, in the year 2024 in the wealthiest country on earth, we can have a situation where an insurer can just decide that they are no longer covering a medication that is the 23rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States. **It helps keep my son alive for God’s sake.** How have we let things slip to such a ridiculous extreme that nobody is standing on their goddamn desk in congress and screaming about this bullshit?

healthcare,USA (NY)-anyone here on the Essentials plan & can a NON-Medicaid doctor write your Rx’s? Please help!," I was recently laid off & so I’m getting new insurance from the NYSOH marketplace. 

I do not qualify for Medicaid bc I earned some income in 2024 before I was laid off. 

But I will qualify for the Essentials plan.

There may be some confusion bc I vaguely remember hearing that the “essentials plan” is actually an umbrella term and there are an array of specific plans within that that you choose to use as your health insurance , with some Medicaid options and some non-Medicaid options that you can choose from.  

(either way, I’d be signing up for a NON Medicaid version of the essentials plan if they offer both)

The “Medicaid” distinction is extremely important for me, bc if you have ANY medicaid plan in NY then ALL of your Rx’s need to be written by a Medicaid doctor  or else your prescriptions won’t be covered by their pharmacy benefits (NYRX)…. And I have one Rx that I need every month from a doctor who is NOT a Medicaid Doctor. I cannot go without this medication and it will take months for me to switch to a Medicaid doctor for my issue (long story).

On the surface, it seems clear that it’s not Medicaid & everyone at the NYSOH exchange keeps telling me that the Essentials plan is NOT considered Medicaid, 

but my pharmacist told me that if you have the essentials plan then your Rx’s nevertheless must be written by a Medicaid doctor bc they have to “run it through the system as Medicaid”. And it will automatically be rejected by the system if the prescribing doctor is not Medicaid covered.

So I don’t know who to believe and I’m really nervous bc if my pharmacist is correct, then I’m gonna be screwed when I go to fill my Rx since it will have been written by a non Medicaid doctor.

The one thing I would REALLY TRUST is If anyone here actually is ON the essential plan and IS able to get their Rx’s filled by a non/medicaid doctor. Does anyone here have any experience with this 🙏?   ANY help would be greatly appreciated!!!",1cgy1ve

publichealth,Regretting my decision already… and I haven’t even really started.,"I just applied for 35 internships this year. Some unpaid. I got to the interview portion of around 10 of them. People tell me that’s “really good and I should be proud” but how dystopian is it that rejection-lite is a good metric in this field? I also have years of tangentially related work experience, like working in an ER and volunteering heavily during Covid. And these are just “entry level” undergrad internships.

Hospitals and health depts just love plugging in nurses with no public health credentials. Half the public health jobs in my state require an “RN” but no bachelors, let alone an MPH. And then the other 1/3rd are home health nursing. And another portion are mostly for PhDs and in academia.

I’m understanding that I need an MPH in quant skills (epi/biostat) if I want to be at all even remotely financially comfortable. But I’m hearing surprising rejection stories everywhere. I’m hearing that there’s been mass layoffs and less funding for these sorts of positions. And the people who often get the grad school spot do something crazy like do mission trips in Uganda that are fully funded by their parents, or have 3 years of cancer research. All of this to maybe wind up in systems mostly designed to prioritize shareholder profit; and not make any “real change” outside of what the medical industrial complex (pharma/insurance/healthcare) allows. (I just read the “uncomfortable truths” thread in this sub).

Rn, I’m taking a 100% by-hand biostatistics class, and I’m told over and over that I’ll never have to do this again outside of the classroom, but it’s very super important that I get an A. I look back and realize a lot of my hardest, most taxing and GPA destroying classes like ochem and calc were a waste of my time and just a way to pad the pockets of the university.

It just feels like a hellish rehashing of premed, but without the guaranteed payoff.
Idk, I wish I had the funds to do it all over and just go into engineering, but I’m 25k in debt and stuck on this road it seems.

Is there any ray of hope or something I can do differently, or any thing I can do to make this process remotely bearable?",1cofi7q

publichealth,Insecure about my job history ,"If anyone could take the time to give me some feedback/advice I would REALLY, really appreciate it. 

I graduated in ‘21 with a BA in Philosophy from a respected liberal arts college. I took a variety of courses covering some public health topics and wrote my thesis on SDOH in public health. 

My work background/life experience background: 
I’m a first-gen graduate and have been low-income my whole life. 

I’m interested in epi, but I’m feeling really insecure about how my work record the last couple of years has been. 

I had a job in staffing at a major metro hospital that I really did not enjoy for several reasons so I left that position to go work for Planned Parenthood. This may sound stupid but I was 21 & no one had really taught me how to budget so I accepted the job with the attitude of “I can make it work.” Well after 6 months at a minimum wage job in a COL crisis, I had to leave the position. 

So I left that job to work in the service industry which pays me $24-25/hour. I was a server at a restaurant for a year that had really shoddy management & wasn’t giving me the hours I wanted. Now I’m a barista making the same amount ($25/h) but I love my job. Only problem is it’s just a job, doesn’t have career advancement, and doesn’t allow me to learn any new skills during the 40 hours a week I’m there. 

I feel like I’m trying my best to make the best decisions for me personally since I have no help from family. I just feel like I have no idea how to get experience at this point or what is valued. I know why I made the decisions I made & why they were best for me but I can’t help but think I look like a “job jumper” who goes from job to job every 1-1.5 years. Maybe that’s typical anyway, I’m not really sure.

 Right now I’m still trying to save up for a car and am wondering where to expend what little extra time/energy I have. 

My main question is would it be better to do some sort of volunteering or better to focus on personal projects that I could put on GitHub which would demonstrate proficiency in R, etc? 

Also wondering how to professionally say/explain “Yes I do have some related work experience but I left those jobs to get paid an extra $8+/h because I need to eat.” Hence my concerns about how to close this experience gap.

publichealth,Comment on: How to get into healthcare data analytics?,"This can vary since that job title is used for a collection of job responsibilities, but I have noticed that generally what prospective employers want are, in no particular order: 

1. Familiarity with sector-specific data sets, processes, and structure, e.g. - claims data stored on cloud servers.
2. Knowledge and experience about the subject, e.g. - vaccines.
3. Experience with technical tools and platforms, like your SASs, SQLs, etc.
4. Biostats knowledge of some form, e.g. - ones used in clinical trials.

I will say that if you haven't worked with data thus far, you really need to. Example data is okay for learning, but real world data has issues that you are expected to address, Likewise, there are standards for how certain data is stored and transmitted, so knowledge of the general layout/templating will help you transform raw data into ones that are appropriate for analysis. Very few places will carve out a role specifically for data analysis, but rather expect their analysts to transform raw(er) data into what is being requested in a timely manner.

For the interview, expect to be able to answer questions around your technical skills, like prior non-school projects.

As an aside, from my experience, government/public sector moves on a snail's pace and misjudges difficulty of certain analysis requests or projects, so you should aim to be ""quicker"" than their expected timelines.",l31gl5n

Now I still work for the same CRO in a different position but in the same division. My current position isn’t actually working on the clinical trials themselves, but is in a more specified area of clinical research. It is unfortunate because at least at CROs, which were always known as the easiest way to gain entry to the clinical research world, a lot of entry level positions are currently being outsourced to other countries where they can pay people less than they can in the US/CA/EU.

globalhealth,Which job do I take ?? ,"Hi existing public health professionals.. 

I’m in my final year of school at Northeastern University, and I have one more co-op (internship) before I graduate. My goal is to pursue an MPH some time in my mid twenties, and work in the field of global health as a profession. Right now, I’m stuck deciding what I want to do for my internship. 

I’ve recently been invited to intern at an NGO in India called Goonj, which works to close equity gaps in health, education, infrastructure, etc. The job would include going to rural villages in India and conducting needs surveys, collecting materials for current projects, spreading awareness about initiatives, etc. I would relocate to Bangalore. The job is unpaid, and I am working on getting funding from my university, but that is the larger turn off associated with this position. 

My other option is working a more typical 9-5 style job in Boston. Potential options include paid work at the massachusetts dept of public health’s academic health department, or other paid work in a public health lab setting / more research focused. 

Greater context: I’ve just come back from a 1.5 year long travel stint this January (I visited India for 2mo on this trip), and I do feel a bit attracted to a steadier routine right now because of this. 

I don’t know if going to India unpaid is stupid given that the paid work would set me up really well for after I graduate. However, I don’t know if it’s stupid of me to pass up an opportunity like working for a freaking NGO in India doing the kind of work I aspire to do just because of money or post-travel fatigue. This could really go either way for me, so any advice is very welcomed. ",1bgdqmx

A radical global health fellowship is helping plug that gap at a fraction of the cost of usual locum staff. More than 1 in 3 of these physicians stay on permanently, providing care to some of Utah’s most rural communities alongside fellows from the next generation of Navajo and Indigenous health care workers.

The approach is unique, says fellowship alum Cristina Rivera Carpenter, PhD, MSN, RN-BC, who grew up in South Dakota and is Mestiza. “As a site fellow, you respect rotating fellows for their choice of coming to work with you in solidarity but you’re not privileging the rotating fellows because they’re US-trained physicians,” she explains. “HEAL brings everyone together on an equal basis, and you grow together over the two years. That decolonization of whose wisdom is centered in a fellowship based at an academic medical center is pretty amazing.”",1aqrw3x

COVID-19 demonstrated that to all of us, but while that threat has abated, it also goes for waterborne diseases which are growing more risky with climate change.

Over the past year, Malawi suffered about 59,000 cholera cases, coming from a new strain of the bacteria, after rains and a cyclone brought on flooding. But the country had gone 20 years without a large outbreak — so where did it come from?

Pakistan — says a new study. Researchers found that the new bacteria was the same strain that circulated during Pakistan’s devastating floods in 2022 and was likely brought into Malawi by an air traveler.

Bugs have always moved across borders, but the case demonstrates the complexities thrown into global health by climate change, and its related events. The study has also highlighted the need for African public health officials to become more wary of climate disasters in faraway places.

In Epic, we have the \*\*\* option which not only helps you jump to particular parts of the chart (by using F3), but also creates a hard stop. in other words you cannot sign your chart until the \*\*\* is resolved or removed. I used the \*\*\* to remind me that I needed to change something in my template for a particular patient. When using templates it can out you at risk for making these mistakes which is why I liked the \*\*\*

  
I know that cerner uses the \_ to jump to particular parts of the chart as well. However, I do not know if this also creates that ""hard stop"" equivalent that the \*\*\* in epic does.

After I found out about the self-proficiency route, I studied and earned a number of certifications. I initially expected the red carpet to be rolled out for me, as someone with a clinical background AND that put in the work for self-proficiency certifications, but sadly that didn't happen. I found out that a lot of orgs wanted seasoned analysts with build experience. 

I must have filled out 200 job applications. I interviewed at least 8 times. Some of those were a waste of time (i.e. a recruiter passing my info along for a job that required build experience when I didn't have it). My last interview went okay. TBH, I didn't think I'd get an offer because some of the questions were technical or someone would ask if I had specific experience (Slicer Dicer) which I just didn't. I got a call back and an offer over my asking! I am stoked I finally found a company willing to give me a shot and it's an opportunity I won't waste.

I hope to make a future post with things I did that I think helped my case, and things to avoid. But if you're in a similar boat, don't give up and keep putting in those applications. Getting told no over and over again is tough, but when it finally pays off, it's a great feeling. ",1ck44af

I applied to both a clinical informatics and an Epic application analyst position at a medical center. The manager reached out and asked me which one I was interested in interviewing for. I told him Clinical Informatics (because I'm doing my master's program in healthcare informatics), so he scheduled the interview for the clinical informatics position.

I don’t particularly care for project management, leading meetings, ensuring staff competence, or being on top of the regulatory stuff. This is what I’m currently doing and it will be all part of the CI role as well.

Was on a Bugsy call and their TS confirmed it as well. Tried to look at the XGM site and grab the slides (in case it shared more details), but was getting a page error in UserWeb. Any Beaker analysts here that went to XGM and want to share some details?

We had always been told that Epic wasn't interested in the blood bank realm because of all the regulation and cost that came along with it. A coworker had heard Judy say she wasn't interested in ever going down that road, but apparently they changed their mind? Very curious for some official statements to come out.",1cht88b
healthIT,Career Path - What to do after Architect Role,"I'm feeling lately like I'm at a bit of a career and salary ceiling and I'm not sure what to do about it.  I'm 42 and have a long while to go before retirement so it's becoming a bit of a nag to me.  In this world, we get boxed into a certain set of skills.  Cerner uses CCL so we don't get real SQL experience we can take elsewhere.  

Regardless, I've been working as an architect for an organization for almost 6 years now.  Before that I was consulting and before that I was at an analyst level (not much of a difference to be honest between analyst/architect).  I started with Cerner, but transitioned to Epic 2 years ago.  

My current role is pretty secure, but I'm getting tired of the organization as they've shifted to a focus on growth.  This means we no longer get yearly COLAs and we haven't had a raise in 4 years (we did get 2, 1 time market adjustments that were beneath inflation percentages).  The market seems pretty dead in the Cerner and Epic space, and most posts I do find are for a support I don't do (I do Ambulatory, which is very dead lately); most recruiters I've spoken with have agreed that the market is really dry right now for both Cerner and Epic.

I feel like I should be looking for the next step beyond architect type work even though there's still plenty of room for me to grow in the role, mainly because I'd like a salary increase.  The few FTE roles I do find posted seem to come with a 10-15k raise, which would be a bit of a sweet spot for me salary wise for now.  I know management is an obvious answer, but I was already passed up for a management role and the next step in the architect world is a team lead, which needs to become available and I'm out-skilled by newer people in our org with 10-15 years of Epic support experience.

So - what can I do for career and salary advancement?  Get a Masters? MBA and go general business (which I'm torn on being effective)? I don't think I can find many management jobs without experience and I don't see the opportunity opening again at my current org.",1choocm

I'm a clinician working to get into health IT, and I'm lucky enough to be in interview processes for both an Epic analyst job and an Epic trainer job (at different health systems). In the extremely lucky event that I get offered both, I want to make an informed decision. 

I've been working through Epic proficiencies and enjoying them. I also enjoy teaching people and I'm good at it (teaching is a big part of my clinical job). I think I'd enjoy both jobs at the entry level, but I'm not sure what it's like growing into the mid- and senior levels. Also not sure if one tends to be more ""secure"" or ""employable"" than the other. 

If past experience or degrees would factor in for long-term career prospects, I have a Bachelor's in an irrelevant field (non-medical, non-tech) and a Master's in my clinical field. My first career was as an Excel data monkey (I was very good at it and I love data, but I got tired of feeling like I was doing meaningless and pointless work, so I went back to school to get into health care). I'm not opposed to getting another degree, but cannot do so right now or in the immediate future.

TeleMedicine,Imperial College London Study Shows Groundbreaking Final Results for SHL Telemedicine’s SmartHeart® in Post-ACS Patient Care (NASDAQ: SHLT),"**Key Findings from the Study:**

* A 76% reduction in the likelihood of hospital readmission within six months for patients using telemedicine.
* A 41% decrease in the likelihood of attending the emergency department (ED) compared to standard care recipients.
* Significant reductions in unplanned coronary revascularizations.
* Notable decreases in patient-reported symptoms, including chest pain, breathlessness, and dizziness.

The TELE-ACS clinical trial, conducted at a large tertiary center in London, UK, from January 2022 to April 2023, involved 337 participants. It has set a new benchmark in the use of telemedicine for the management of post-ACS patients by reducing hospital readmissions, ED visits, lowering unplanned revascularization rates and improving patient outcomes. The investigator initiated trial results, led by Dr. Ramzi Khamis and Nasser S. Alshahrani, were presented at the prestigious American College of Cardiology's 24th Annual Scientific Session & Expo Late-Breaking Clinical Trials Sessions (ACC 24 LBCT) in Atlanta. Moreover, the study was also published in the leading Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC).

Erez Nachtomy, CEO of SHL Telemedicine, commented on the significance of these results, stating: ""The results of this pivotal study alongside their presentation at ACC 24, and publication in JACC, serve as a resounding vote of confidence in SHL and our SmartHeart® platform as a transformative technology for cardiac care and telemedicine as a whole. These groundbreaking clinical results are an endorsement that propels us forward in our mission to redefine patient care, demonstrating the tangible benefits and efficiency of our telemedicine solutions on a global scale.""

# What is the ACA?

The Affordable Care Act is a comprehensive health care reform law enacted in March 2010 sometimes known as ACA, PPACA, or “Obamacare”.

The law has 3 primary goals:

1. Make affordable health insurance available to more people. The law provides consumers with subsidies (“premium tax credits”) that lower costs for households with incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level.
2. Expand the Medicaid program to cover all adults with income below 138% of the federal poverty level. (Not all states have expanded their Medicaid programs.)
3. Support innovative medical care delivery methods designed to lower the costs of  health care generally.

With regard to your employer, if your employer has over 50 employees, they are required to provide you a compliant insurance that meets Minimum Essential Coverage and Minimum Value standards. Your employer also must subsidize at least 50% of the premium to enroll the employees.

# What is Open Enrollment?

[https://www.healthcare.gov/quick-guide/dates-and-deadlines](https://www.healthcare.gov/quick-guide/dates-and-deadlines)

[https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/open-enrollment-period/](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/open-enrollment-period/)

The yearly period when people can enroll in a health insurance plan. Open Enrollment for 2025 runs from November 1, 2024 through January 15, 2025.

Insurance plans elected during Open Enrollment before December 15th, 2024 will start as early as January 1, 2025. If a plan is elected after December 15, 2024, the plan will start on February 1st, 2025.

Outside the Open Enrollment Period, you generally can enroll in a health insurance plan only if you qualify for a Special Enrollment Period. You’re eligible if you have certain life events, like getting married, having a baby, or losing other health coverage.

The following states have permanently adopted expanded enrollment periods:

* California: November 1 to January 31
* District of Columbia: November 1 to January 31
* Idaho: October 15 to December 15
* Kentucky: November 1 to January 16
* Maine: November 1 to January 16
* Massachusetts: November 1 to January 23
* New Jersey: November 1 to January 31
* New York: November 16 to January 31

# Why do we have Open Enrollment (OE)?

OE is designed for anyone eligible to purchase on the marketplace to make their elections for 2025. With the introduction of the ACA legislation, you cannot buy ACA insurance whenever you want – this prevents people from enrolling only when they know they need the health insurance, which drives up prices for everyone. Economics at work.

# Why do you need health insurance?

Medical costs are the leading cause for bankruptcy in the US, and everyone is always healthy until they are not. By enrolling in an ACA compliant healthcare plan, you receive the benefits of a provider network, contracted negotiated rates on services, an out of pocket max which caps your personal spending each year, and other state/federal protections on your healthcare experience.

# What is the marketplace and who can use it?

Any US citizen or qualifying immigration status ([https://www.healthcare.gov/immigrants/immigration-status/](https://www.healthcare.gov/immigrants/immigration-status/)) that is not incarcerated may purchase health insurance off of the marketplace. **Please only use [healthcare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov) for finding marketplace insurance!**

# Who is in my Household?

Household = you, spouse, tax dependents. It is not necessarily who you physically live with.

# What is the APTC and who is eligible?

The APTC stands for Advanced Premium Tax Credit and is a subsidy provided to people with incomes between 138 – 400% of the Federal Poverty Level. If your state has not expanded Medicaid, the income becomes 100 – 400% of the Federal Poverty Level. You are eligible for the APTC if your income falls in this range and you have no employer insurance available. If you are Medicaid eligible, you should apply there as you will not qualify for the APTC; however, you are welcome to purchase a full price marketplace plan instead if you prefer.

# What is the Federal Poverty Level (FPL)?

The Federal Poverty Level/Line is a measure of income issued every year by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Federal poverty levels are used to determine your eligibility for certain programs and benefits, including savings on Marketplace health insurance, and Medicaid and CHIP coverage.

The 2024 federal poverty level (FPL) income numbers below are used to calculate eligibility for Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). 2023 numbers are slightly lower, and are used to calculate savings on Marketplace insurance plans for 2024.

|Family Size|2023 Income numbers|2024 Income numbers|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Individuals|$14,580|$15,060|
|Family of 2|$19,720|$20,440|
|Family of 3|$24,860|$25,820|
|Family of 4|$30,000|$31,200|
|Family of 5|$35,140|$36,580|
|Family of 6|$40,280|$41,960|
|Family of 7|$45,420|$47, 340|
|Family of 8|$50, 560|$52,720|
|Family of 9 or more|Add $5,140 for each additional person|Add $5,380 for each additional person|

\*note: Hawaii and Alaska both have higher poverty levels.

# How the FPL and APTC work together:

* Income above 400% FPL: If your income is above 400% FPL, you may now qualify for premium tax credits that lower your monthly premium for a Marketplace health insurance plan.
* Income between 100% and 400% FPL: If your income is in this range, in all states you qualify for premium tax credits that lower your monthly premium for a Marketplace health insurance plan.
* Income at or below 150% FPL: If your income falls at or below 150% FPL in your state and you’re not eligible for Medicaid or CHIP, you may qualify to enroll in or change Marketplace coverage through a Special Enrollment Period.
* Income below 138% FPL: If your income is below 138% FPL and your state has expanded Medicaid coverage, you qualify for Medicaid based only on your income.
* Income below 100% FPL: If your income falls below 100% FPL, you probably won’t qualify for savings on a Marketplace health insurance plan or for income-based Medicaid.

# States with Expanded Medicaid

In 2024, there are only 10 states that have **not** expanded Medicaid. They are:

* Alabama
* Florida
* Georgia
* Kansas
* Mississippi
* South Carolina
* Tennessee
* Texas
* Wisconsin
* Wyoming

# What happens if I don't enroll in a plan during open enrollment?

If you don’t enroll in an ACA-compliant health insurance plan by the end of open enrollment, your buying options will likely be very limited for the coming year. Open enrollment won’t come around again until November, with coverage effective the first of the following year.

But depending on the circumstances, you might still be able to get coverage after open enrollment ends:

* Medicaid and CHIP enrollment are available year-round for those who qualify.
* Native Americans can enroll year-round
* Special enrollment period if you have a qualifying event

# Will I have to pay a fee if I don't have insurance?

If you didn’t have coverage during 2023, the fee no longer applies. This means you don’t need an exemption in order to avoid the penalty. However, some states charge a fee if you don't have health coverage. If you live in a state that requires you to have health coverage and you don’t have coverage (or an exemption), you’ll be charged a fee when you file your state taxes. These states are: California, District of Columbia, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Rhode Island.

# Let’s talk about Plan Structures

Metal tiers are a quick way to categorize plans based on what that split is.

Some people get confused because they think metal tiers describe the quality of the plan or the quality of the service they’ll receive, which isn’t true.

Here’s how health insurance plans roughly split the costs, organized by metal tier:

* Bronze – 40% consumer / 60% insurer
* Silver – 30% consumer / 70% insurer
* Gold – 20% consumer / 80% insurer
* Platinum – 10% consumer / 90% insurer

The minimum you’ll spend per year is the annual cost of your premiums.

The maximum you’ll spend per year is the sum of the annual premium plus the out of pocket maximum.

If you don’t intend to max out the plan with expected medical costs, you should calculate your estimated costs. This could be the sum of the annual premiums + deductible. If your plan has copays, it would be the sum of the annual premiums + copays on services you know you need.

# What is a deductible?

The amount you pay for covered health care services before your insurance plan starts to pay.

With a $2,000 deductible, for example, you pay the first $2,000 of *covered* services yourself. After you pay your deductible, you usually pay only a copayment or coinsurance for covered services. Your insurance company pays the rest.

Generally, plans with lower monthly premiums have higher deductibles. Plans with higher monthly premiums usually have lower deductibles.

# Coinsurance

The percentage of costs of a covered health care service you pay (20%, for example) after you've paid your deductible.

Let's say your health insurance plan's allowed amount for an office visit is $100 and your coinsurance is 20%.

If you've paid your deductible: You pay 20% of $100, or $20. The insurance company pays the rest.

If you haven't met your deductible: You pay the full allowed amount, $100.

# Copayment

A fixed amount ($20, for example) you pay for a covered health care service after you've paid your deductible.

Let's say your health insurance plan's allowable cost for a doctor's office visit is $100. Your copayment for a doctor visit is $20.

If you've paid your deductible: You pay $20, usually at the time of the visit.

If you haven't met your deductible: You pay $100, the full allowable amount for the visit.

Copayments (sometimes called ""copays"") can vary for different services within the same plan, like drugs, lab tests, and visits to specialists.

Generally plans with lower monthly premiums have higher copayments. Plans with higher monthly premiums usually have lower copayments.

# Out of Pocket Maximum

The most you have to pay for covered services in a plan year. After you spend this amount on deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance for in-network care and services, your health plan pays 100% of the costs of covered benefits.

The out-of-pocket limit ***doesn't*** include:

* Your monthly premiums
* Anything you spend for services your plan doesn't cover
* Out-of-network care and services
* Costs above the allowed amount for a service that a provider may charge
* The out-of-pocket limit for Marketplace plans varies, but can’t go over a set      amount each year.

# Short Term Health Plans

Under general federal rules, short-term health insurance plans can have initial terms of up to 364 days and a total duration of up to 36 months, including renewals. But the majority of the states placed more restrictive limits on the availability of short-term plans, and those state limits supersede the new federal rules. Every  state has its own rules, please check with your states department of insurance to see if your state has limitations to short term plans. **These are also generally NOT ACA-compliant plans.** As a whole, this subreddit does not encourage short term plans, but if the option is short term plan or bankruptcy, we would encourage some coverage.

# I have two or more insurances. How do I know which one is primary and which is secondary? 

This is called a Cordination of Benefits. Each insurance you are covered by needs to know who is going to pay the most for your health care, and that will be your primary insurance. All insurances want to be the last payor, so it's important you know who is in charge of paying the most. 

Your primary will be the coverage where you are the policy holder (aka subscriber). In the case of two commercial insurances where you are the policy holder on both, this can be tricky. Generally in that case, the insurance you've had longer would be primary and the other secondary. Please see below if there is a non commercial insurance involved.

Next, secondary coverage will be anything you are a dependent on. If you are under 26, this might be your parents insurance. It could be your spouses policy. 

If you are over 65 and you are working, or have a spouse who is working and you are covered under their policy, that insurance will be primary over Medicare benefits. 

Now, if there are two policies and one is Tricare or Medicaid, those will be the payors of last resort, meaning you will always have a commercial policy be primary over Tricare and Mediciad if there is a commercial insurance involved. In the case of having both Tricare and Medicaid, Medicaid will be the last payor. For example, say a patient has Tricare, Aetna, and Medicaid. The order of benefits would be Aetna (regardless if they are the policy holder or not), Tricare, and then Mediciad. 

Finally, Tricare for Life can only be secondary to Medicare or a Medicare Advantage plan. 

It is important that your insurances know who is primary in the chain of your benefits. Whenever you gain a new insurance, call all insurances involved and ask to update your Cordination of Benefits. Some insurances will deny claims until this is done, meaning you will be responsible for the full bill until you call your insurance. A billing office or provider cannot update your coordination of benefits for you as that would be a violation of HIPAA.

# What is the No Surprises Act and why is it important? 

Starting for dates of service (aka the date of appointments, encounters, or ER trips) January 1, 2022 patients have billing protection from the a federal law called the No Surprises Act (NSA). The NSA states when getting emergency care, non-emergency care from out-of-network providers at in-network facilities, and air ambulance services from out-of-network providers, the patient is protected from outrageous bills. The NSA aims to protect consumers, excessive out-of-pocket costs are restricted, and emergency services must continue to be covered without any prior authorization, and regardless of whether or not a provider or facility is in-network.

For example, Jane is hit by a car and needs to go to the hospital. She hit her head durning the accident and is in and out of consciousness. EMS take a ground ambulance from the accident to the closest emergency room. She receives emergency surgery to fix an internal bleed and also a fractured leg. Jane stays at the hospital for 5 days total. Jane has insurance from her employer and walks out a little worse for wear, but now is worried about all the bills she is going to receive. She has a $500 deductible and $2000 out of pocket max.

In Jane's case, her insurance is suppose to cover nearly all of her care, even if she was taken to an out of network hospital and admitted to the ER. She did not have any choice in who she received care from as it was an emergency situation. If she receives a bill for say the anesthesiologist who was out of network, she would need to call her insurance and see if they have a claim on file and ask it to be reprocessed under the NSA. The most Jane could owe the hospital and it's affiliates is $2000, her out of pocket max.

Now, what isn't covered under the NSA? Unfortunately, there are some issues that Jane will need to handle herself. For example, the ground ambulance ride she took may not be covered by her insurance, and the NSA does not cover ground ambulances. Air ambulances are covered however, Jane was not going to be taken by a helicopter to a hospital for that situation. 

Next, the NSA does not cover non-emergency situations. This includes an office visit to a out of network doctor, or an elective procedure in an out of network facility. In those cases, you may be balance billed for the full amount as it is up to you to know who is covered under your plan. Please call your doctors office and insurance to be sure they accept your insurance and specific plan. Often offices will request a picture of your insurance card for this.

HealthInsurance,A PSA: What does it mean for an insurance to be ACA compliant?,"!!!!! AKA PLEASE READ BEFORE CONSIDERING BUYING ""PRIVATE INSURANCE"" !!!!!!


Hello all! I wanted to make a quick post to you all talking about the importance of knowing your options with health insurance. There has been a sudden increase in the comments suggesting redditors to look into ""the private marketplace"" to find coverage. 

What is the private marketplace? Simply put, these are ""plans"" or policies that can only be sold to you by a broker or agent. This subreddit has a very strict ""no solicitation"" rule that is absolutely enforced. We do NOT want any of our fellow redditors to be taken advantage of in any way, which is why this post is being made. Further, it gives an opportunity to discuss what makes these private marketplace policies potentially problematic.

Most of these policies are not ACA compliant. The Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) has three major goals: 
1. Allow Americans access to affordable health insurance by providing tax credits to those who qualify. 
2. Expand Medicaid to cover more individuals. Medicaid has rules for every state, but to this day only 10 states have not expanded their Medicaid programs. 
3. Try to lower health care costs in general. 

Thanks to the ACA, there are many things that most Americans have the right to now that wasn't available before. For example, free preventative care. Getting an annual physical should not be a matter of health versus money. Additionally, pre-existing conditions are no longer a factor in ACA health plans. The most important benefit to many of us is the ability to appeal the insurances decisions as a patient. YOU are the most important advocate for yourself, and the right to appeal makes it so.
One obvious benefit that the ACA has created is being able to find coverage using healthcare.gov. 

These private marketplace policies should be taken in caution, as many are not ACA compliant. That being said, do they have some benefits? I can argue yes for *some* of them. I even have a cancer insurance policy through my employer's trusted broker with Aflac. But if I were to have cancer, my health insurance will be the first to protect my medical stability, not the supplemental cancer policy. When looking into health insurance, be aware that anything not from the open marketplace or state could be non-ACA compliant. Nearly all employers plans are ACA compliant as well. 

Anyways, back to our regularly scheduled programing. Please ask questions! We want to help :)",1as0fwv
HealthInsurance,Dupixent prescriptions are not counting towards my deductible.,"Hello all I would greatly appreciate assistance on this matter.

Age: 25
Zip code: 77019
Income: $65,000

I’m in the state of Texas. 

I am prescribed Dupixent for severe eczema. I have employer insurance, Blue Cross Blue Shield PPO Plan with a deductible of $3200. 

From what it appears based on what the blue cross support specialist told me, the specialty pharmacy, Accredo, is reversing pharmacy claims, even though I’ve received my prescriptions. This is preventing me from meeting my deductible.

I do have a dupixent my-way card that pays the rest of the balance. I was told that whenever insurance companies reverse claims due to manufacturer co-pay cards, it is called a “copay accumulator.” 

Based on my research, this is illegal in several states. In fact, it became illegal in the state of Texas in September of 2023. 

I am wondering for advice on any next steps. Do I contact the specialty pharmacy and demand that they stop reversing my claims? So far my experience with them has been terrible, what do I say to them etc. Or do I reach out to my insurance again? Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.

HealthInsurance,If you get a promotion would you get open enrollment for your health insurance again?,"My SO is in the running for a promotion, and he currently does not have insurance through his employer. He’s still under a parent because he isn’t 26 yet, but familial relation is rocky. If he were to choose that he wants to get his own insurance, would him getting offered this promotion mean that they would also give him open enrollment so that he could elect for coverage at this time? Our other thought was that we plan to legally tie the knot soon (just signing papers). I have employer insurance right now, so I know the option would be opem for us in terms of my insurance, but we don’t know if his insurance offer may be better for a couple than my company has, so if we were to get married would trying to get coverage through his employer offered insurance even consider enrollment under the terms of significant life event likt we’d be able to swing with my insurance?

The bills: [https://imgur.com/a/uHojGpq](https://imgur.com/a/uHojGpq)

Any advice on navigating this other than just paying the higher amount due?

I noticed on my EoB document that the procedure is also missing one of the codes that is listed below in the same document:

- UUBH01 - Based on an agreement with United Healthcare or United Behavioral Health, the provider has accepted a discount for this service.

HealthInsurance,Overwhelmed and depressed at the offered plans," I was laid off and COBRA was too expensive. I'm Texas, 30s, female, mostly healthy. I have anemia, fibroids, endometriosis, and need mental health therapy. I eventually want to have surgery to remove endometriosis lesions.

High premiums, that barely cover any portions on visits, don't over telemedicine, trying to pick which of my current doctors/clinics I'm willing to sacrifice because I either will have 2 that are in network or 15. I love Kelsey Seybold, but they only accept 2 of the marketplace plans, two which don't cover any of the other doctors or clinics I like going too. It's such bullshit. Why am I having to pay $300-500 just to end up paying most of the care costs???  

**How do y'all sort through this mayhem?** I've been on this website for hours and still can't decide. I know I can change plans next enrollment period, but I feel stuck and I'm afraid that I may not be able to access doctors or clinics I need when something happens. I don't want to choose the wrong plan then be stuck with until open enrollment, which is also bullshit because if a company puts out a shitty plan I should be able to leave when I want.",1cp8jdt

HealthInsurance,Imagine 360 insurance,"My daughter is 1 year old, she had her preventative care check up(supposed to be free) and doctor wouldn’t give vaccines since insurance never approved it. Now, the hospital contacted insurance, who’s saying they’ll only cover $100 out of $800. The hospital said there are free vaccines for people who aren’t covered by insurance, the problem is, insurance is claiming they’re covering it 100%, but they clearly aren’t. Is this legal?

This insurance is so bad, the hospitals won’t even see us without a financial disclosure being signed prior to being seen, it all has to be paid up front. Most primary care doctors won’t even accept us with this insurance. 

Does insurance have to cover 100% of the cost of these vaccines if they claim they are? 

One more question, the employer promised the entire company in the first insurance meeting, that no one would be balance billed, and they promised as a company, they would pick up the tab. Would this be a legally binding verbal contract, it was said in front of 200+ people. A coworker was balance billed $17,000 for a colonoscopy which should be free preventative care. I was balance billed $400 for my other daughter yearly checkup, again, it’s supposed to be free.

HealthInsurance,BCBS of MA Saying I have an Overpayment and owe them on claims from Nov 2022,"So I have BCBS of MA but I don't live in Mass, and I had an out of network therapist.

I would send paper claims to BCBS to see what they would cover.

In Oct 2022 BCBS updated my ID (b/c my company changed owners) but I still had the same exact plan, and even my deductible wasn't restarted or anything. Literally the only change was my ID. So when I sent the November 2022 claims I put the \*new\* ID just like I knew I should.

They still processed it as my old ID and denied them. I had to call them and talk to someone and explain that I didn't even put the old ID on the claim, and have the reprocess it under the new ID. Which eventually they did, after multiple different discussions and explanations. Eventually I got reimbursed for it.

I got a letter in the mail today saying I owe them several hundred dollars. They're saying that I wasn't covered (which is bull - I'm literally using the same ID today, with the same coverage). I've been with BCBS of MA for literally almost 13 years at this point.

I feel like they're just going to keep coming back to me saying that I wasn't covered, because I must've talked to them a thousand times it feels like. I'm tired of talking to them about this.

My overall question is, these claims are from November of 2022. I know that I, myself, only had 180 days to submit the claim to them. Can they really come back 1.5 years later and demand payment from me if I just ignored it?

Like what is their actual legal recourse?

Could they cancel my current policy (under a different ID, and technically different company ownership) even though I know they reviewed the claims as if they were under an old ID?

There was nothing in the letter that seemed like threatening, like I \*had\* to pay, is that because they can't make me pay, and are really just hoping I will pay them if they ask nicely? lol


Edit:


I just noticed there's some other claims they're including as well, and their reasoning is duplicative payments. I don't believe they paid anything duplicatively. I'm not even sure how I would prove that anymore since I don't have my claim history from over a year ago.",1cp1ygv
HealthInsurance,Prior Authorization Request Denied,"In January, my wife's employer switched insurance providers to Anthem Blue Cross. Prior to this, I have been undergoing a multi-step treatment plan for severe sleep apnea, which involved an initial surgery 2.5 years ago, followed by 2 years of braces and expanders, and my doctors are finally ready for the final surgery, which they believe will immediately relieve my symptoms and reduce my sleep index from 80 to 10, a level that would be actually manageable with a CPAP or other treatment.

I was scheduled to have surgery May 15. Anthem received the prior authorization request about six weeks ago. They did not get back to us until last week, saying they were denying it as it was not deemed medically necessary. My doctor did a peer-to-peer review the next day, but yesterday we learned that, while they acknowledge the medical necessity, their rules require a step-wise approach (whatever that means). My doctor has submitted an appeal, but has told me that he expects it to take 6 weeks to hear from them.

However, my wife and I have jumped through so many hoops to arrange our schedules, finances, and additional childcare for the 4 weeks of recovery time.

HealthInsurance,Can Health Insurance legally provide different coverage from what is in the policy documents given to policyholder? ,"I'm running into this for Aetna.

I was undergoing physical therapy at a physical therapy department of a hospital. According to my insurance coverage, it should be copay only with deductible waived. But Aetna billed it at full deductible, and then a % after deductible is met because they said 'it was done in an outpatient facility of a hospital'

My issue is that the Aetna website Medical Coverage page for physical therapy doesn't mention this distinction. It only mentions the copay and that deductible is waived. Then when I go into the more detailed 32-page Benefits Overview doc, or the 125-page Benefit Plan Description doc, it also does not break down that the coverage is different for physical therapy in a hospital setting. It also only mentions copay there and no deductible there.

There ARE services like 'infusion therapy' where if the coverage is different based on where it is performed, it is clearly broken down in the table with the coverage level for each setting in the detailed benefits overview. For Physical Therapy, it just mentions copay and deductible waived and no breakdown provided.

So now I'm stuck where the insurance is insisting on a set of coverage conditions that are not mentioned in their plan documents that I thoroughly read when I signed up but the agents see it on their end. Even the agent on the phone said they had told their higher ups to document the different coverage for physical therapy in plan documents many times but it hasn't happened.  
  
If I appeal, the agent told me even if they cover the first visit on copay and waived deductible, they won't cover future physical therapy claims on copay so i'd be stuck in the same condition. But when I signed up for the full year, I signed up based on the plan documents and the coverage that was listed in them at the time (and is still listed).

Can Insurance just change plan coverage documents with different conditions mid-way through the year? Is that Legal?",1coygye

HealthInsurance,A Noob Trying to Get Health Insurance. Let's Talk People!,"Hello. Age 37, South Dakota, and about $1800 a month after taxes.

Yes, it is true that I am a noob, and I am here with hat in hand, heart on sleeve and beer in fridge since last year.

So, here is the art of the deal. I need you to explain to me like I am 5 or like I am Homer Simpson about insurance, and I will cut right through the chase.

This year I was diagnosed with Hiatal Hernia, and I need endoscopy done and most likely surgery done. But I can't pay out of pocket. I applied for Medicaid, but I don't qualify due to the fact I make too much. I make peanuts and I make over the limit by 400 dollars even though the Medicaid site says $1700 is the cut off and I pull in about $1800 LOL.

I live in South Dakota, and I was looking at healthcare website and most plans are expensive. I make very little a month, and all goes to bills and I make too much for Medicaid by a few hundred dollars.

I am basically getting insurance for Endoscopy and HH surgery. And, and so this is where you the person reading this comes in and gives some advice to a dummy like me. I don't know much about deductibles, PPOs and EPOS or all that jazz.

And I was talking with a healthcare gov guy yesterday and he said if I put in an application before May 31st, I will get it in June. And told to look at the plans online. But I don't know which is the best for me price wise or which will cover most of my surgery.

Again, don't have a clue at all about premiums and deductibles. Get ready to laugh, so when I hear a \*example\* $500 or $700 deductible what does that mean exactly? does that mean I pay $500 or $700 or does it mean it will only cover my surgery for that much.

I am low income and pull in peanuts so remember that part. Go easy on me smart people and tell me what I got to do.

Thanks.",1coouxn

HealthInsurance,"[Texas] I was laid off last month, but my insurance is apparently still active. I just renewed a discounted gym membership through my insurance. Will I have to pay that back and how much?","So I just found out my insurance is still active even though I was laid off last month. I’ve got marketplace starting out next month, so I thought I was going to try and make it through the month without Insurance. However, I’ve been hoping to buy a gym membership and my old insurance has a discounted membership program. 

I just signed up through them and paid the enrollment fee. I read somewhere that Cobra will probably kick in retroactively and I will have to pay it if I were to use my insurance, but how does it work if it’s a benefit that comes with insurance? 

So basically, if I use this discounted program, will I be charged anything retroactively or not?

HealthInsurance,UHC Copay Accumulator - Colorado Ban,"I am on a medicine that has a copay card/coupon. Without the card, the total is over the amount of my deductible. UHC has a copay accumulator set to prevent all copay amounts from going towards a deductible. So, pretty much it is not saving me any money since I have to pay my deductible and out of pocket max. 

Colorado signed a ban on copay accumulator’s last summer. All verbiage makes the ban seem immediate but at the bottom of the legislation it says it affects all plans started or renewed on 01/01/25. Does that mean that the ban is not active yet? I called UHC about it and they said they have a national policy and have never heard of a ban. 

Is this something I can fight? It saves me thousands of dollars if I can, but I’m not a legislative expert. It seems ridiculous to me that a ‘coupon’ to make something more affordable is not saving me any money.

These are epidemiological studies on the prevalence of a disease in the general population and there is no exposure, so no comparison between cases in exposed and non-exposed subjects is made. The only data available is how many subjects in the sample exhibit the disease. Is there a way for me to calculate d by only using the information provided in the article?",1ckplhp

epidemiology,Interventional or cohort? ,"Hello, I'm a bit confused about cohort study design. I was taught that it's an observational study, no intervention/treatment. So if a group of physicians prescribe an approved med that is part of routine care/standard of care to 1 group of patients and follow them for x number of months, does this qualify as an observational cohort study? 

My colleague defines a cohort study as a study with 1 intervention and no randomization. While I agree with no randomization, I don't think an intervention is part of a cohort study design. How do physicians then conduct an observational cohort study if they wanna study their patients who they prescribe approved drugs that are part of standard of care?

epidemiology,Comment on: Interventional or cohort? ,"Don't confuse yourself with all this lingo. Intervention is just synonymous with treatment which is synonymous with exposure. All those words are as acceptable in randomised control trials as they are observational studies. After all, observational studies aim to quantify the effect of an exposure/intervention/treatment the same randomised control trials.

Clearer terminology is experimental study design or just calling them randomised control trials which are not ambiguous about what the study design is. I think it's bad practice to call randomised control trials or clinical trials interventional studies...

Also, onto cohort studies, they are longitudinal and they don't involve randomisation. They can similarly quantify the effect of drug treatments and interventions as RCTs.",l2frtej
epidemiology,Comment on: Interventional or cohort? ,"Hey glad to help!

  
1.) I think it's bad to call RCTs or clinical trials interventional studies because of the confusion. Your questions are not unusual but it sems from inconsistent terminology across different specialists. I'm not sure what background your colleague has but it's likely that they use this terminology amongst themselves. Modern epidemiologists tend to want to keep things as simple as possible. By saying randomised control trial we just eliminate any ambiguity which is still present if you say intervention study. Intervention study could be interpreted in many different ways depending on the person. This is not just about this. In general, life would be so easy if we all had one word to describe the same thing. For example, economists call it omitted variable bias whereas epidemiologists called it confounding bias. Also, it's based on my experiences, my educational background (I studied Epi masters) and reading the literature. You kind of get used it it but sometimes it can be challenging when starting in a field of study.

  
2.) No time threshold. As long as you are measuring something through time, it is longitudinal. Could be a week e.g., following a cohort over a week with daily measurements, all the way to a decade follow-up time with yearly measurements.",l2grn0w

epidemiology,Studying Impact of Phone Calls in Improving Health Outcomes of at Insurance Members - No Randomization,"Hi all. I work as a health quality analyst at an insurer. I'm being asked to evaluate if an intervention to reach out to members by phone led to improved health quality metrics. We did not randomize the phones because without informed consent it would be unethical to provide outreach to one half and withhold from the other. This leads to the question of how to best evaluate. So far the best I've come up with is to compare members we did reach by phone to those we did not. This is not a perfect cohort design, but I'm otherwise at a loss for how to do this with academic rigor. The other issue is whether we include members we specifically had a wrong phone number for or include them with the members we could only leave a voicemail for. My colleague is of the opinion that we should not include them because we never actually had a chance to reach those members, but I simply don't understand why that population should be excluded when we are including members that we could only leave a voicemail for. If the exposure is direct interaction with the member, shouldn't we include any member that did not get direct interaction as a comparison rather than removing them from the analysis altogether?

Occasionally we need to consider the potential acceptance of a new vaccine if there might be some push-back or controversy, sometimes we'll look at the justifications for recommendations for the same vaccine when used abroad, but there's no formal process to follow for aspects like that. I'd like to get one developed for economic evaluations.

Some NITAGs, like the JCVI in the UK, require economic evaluations by default. For us, occasionally we'll consider cost-effectiveness but we also don't have the right to not recommend a new vaccine if it appears to be not cost-effective. We also don't use a threshold for ICERs to determine cost-effectiveness, so a vaccine with an ICER of >200,000 € per QALY saved (for example) could still be recommended to a large target population. In other countries that would be rejected flat-out.

When trying to find literature on this topic all I can find is guidelines for conducting economic evaluations (Drummond et al., etc), but nothing yet for deciding if one is necessary.

biology,"Good, entertaining nature documentaries to show my younger sister?","I wanna get my sister into watching documentaries like me at her age (she's 7) and I honestly have no idea where to even start looking for good documentaries, there are millions on YT.

*She LOVED Our Planet for example.*
I think she liked how they ""humanized"" the animals they showed by giving them a personality (e.g. the flirty Birds of Paradise) and treating their families/packs/herds/flocks like human families with their respective ""roles"" (e.g. with a loving mother, siblings that love to compete and fight, a protective and imposing father). 

And I remember having watched documentaries that followed the life of an animal as they were born, reached maturity, had their family, etc. so I'd love to find that one and documentaries/shows that were the same, with some humor and fun but without being too childish or hiding harsh truths.

But she gets bored with the more ""verbose"" and ""technical"" documentaries like the ones about paleontology, and I get it, all they show is pretty much ""a bunch of rocks, deserts, and people talking"".

biology,Share the most bizarre animal you know!,"As title says. Click for the picture! 



I will mention about a pokemon like creature: Blind Mole Rats (Nannospalax and Spalax genus) and make a list why I think it is a bizarre animal. FYI they are evolutionary much closer to mice or rat compared to African blind mole rats. The list is below the image.

0- They have bizarre look! No eyes, no tail, no external ear, very strong jaw and strong bite that can cut your finger off, they are super aggressive, but they have very fluffy fur!

1- They live in underground tunnel systems alone (not like African naked mole rats with social colonies) and almost never leave their tunnels. The tunnel system has different rooms for food storage, toiled, bedroom, newborn care room, and even deep tunnel drainage for water float.

2-They have chromosomal number variation within same species (I guess ranging from 36 to 60). There are 25+ chromosomal race within this species which means different populations have different number of chromosomes.

3-They are resistant to cancer.

4-They are also ""resistant"" to aging. While similar size of rodents (i.e. rats) can live up to \~5 years in captivity. One researcher recorded an individual older than 30 years!

5- They communicate with hitting their heads on the top of tunnels which is called ""drumming"", basically saying ""this is my territory f\*ck off!"" :)

biology,Whats natural selection?,"Hey all, 

is this a good answer to the natural selection question?

Natural selection is the mechanism by which evolution happens. Evolution is the change in allele frequency in a population over time, natural selection is one mechanism that drives that. Natural selection acts on the genetic variation within a population created by mutations and recombination. It is the process by which forms of life having traits that better enable them to adapt to specific environmental pressures, as predators, changes in climate, or competition for food or mates, will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers than others of their kind, thus ensuring the inheritance of these favorable traits in succeeding generations.

**Type:** Homework

**Level:** High school

**System:** Cats

**Topic:** Dihybrid cross

Question: “The genetic principles that Mendel uncovered apply to animals as well as plants. In cats, for instance, Black (B) is dominant over brown (b) fur color and Short (S) fur is dominant over long (s) fur. Suppose a family has a black, short-furred male, heterozygous for both of these traits that they mate with a heterozygous black, long-furred female. Determine and present the genotypes of the two parent animals, the likely gametes they could produce and assuming they have multiple, large liters what is the proportion of kittens of each possible phenotype (color and length) that the family might expect.”

**Answer:** N/A

**What I know:** I understand how to do a Punnett square with one allele. For example, Bb x Bb.

||B|b|
|:-|:-|:-|
|B|BB|Bb|
|b|Bb|bb|

**What I don’t know:** I don’t know how to properly set up the Punnett square to incorporate the additional S (fur length) allele in the gamete.

**What I tried:** I tried Googling “cat fur genetics” and didn’t find any useful examples.

**Other:** What happens if there is another allele added to these?

**This format causes me abject pain, why do I have to fill out the template?**

1. We want folks to learn and understand. Requiring the user to put in effort helps curb the number of “drive-by problem sets” being dumped onto the sub from users expecting the internet to complete their assignments.
2. Posters often do not include enough information to adequately help answer the question. This format eliminates much of the guesswork for respondents and it allows responders quickly assess the level of knowledge and time needed to answer the question.
3. This format allows the posts to be programmatically archived, tagged, and referenced at later times for other students.

**Type:** Where did the question come from? Knowing the origin of the question can help us formulate the best available answer. For example, the question might come from homework, an exam, a course, a paper, an article, or just a thought you had.

**Level:** What is the expected audience education level of the question and answer? This helps us determine if the question should be answered in the manner of, “Explain like I’m 5” or “I’m the PI of a mega lab, show me the dissertation” E.g.--elementary school, high school, undergraduate, research, nonacademic, curiosity, graduate, layperson

**System:** Which species, system, or field does the question pertain? E.g.—human, plant, in silico, cancer, health, astrobiology, fictional world, microbiology

**Topic:** What topic is being covered by the question? Some examples might include Mendelian genetics, mitosis, codon bias, CRISPR, or HWE.

**Question:** This is where you should type out the question verbatim from the source.

**Answer:** If you’ve been provided an answer already, put it here. If you don’t have the answer, leave this blank or fill in N/A.

**What I know:** Tell us what you understand about the problem already. We need to get a sense of your current domain knowledge before answering. This also forces you to engage with the problem.

**What I don’t know:** Tell us where you’re getting stuck or what does not make sense.

**What I tried:** Tell us how you’ve approached the problem already. What worked? What did not work?

**Other:** You can put whatever you want here or leave it blank. This is a good place to ask follow-up questions and post links.",1cehvn0

genetics,"""Autocompleting"" Ancestry DNA Data","Hi all, I just ordered a genetic testing kit via ancestry to see if I can find some relatives. However, I have been playing with the idea of making some art by visualizing my own genome. Since it seems that you can download the genetic data once you get it, is there a way of complementing the non-SNP areas that were not tested for with the ""human default genome"" so that I would get a complete genome sequence of myself? Of course it would not be 100% true, but close. I am good at programming so I would have the ability to download a reference genome and override the SNPs with the ancestry data.

How can I proceed (how can I get some ""standard human"" data)? And how accurate would the results be (how much of my personal genetic makeup would I miss by using this ""autocomplete"" process)?",1col0i2

genetics,Treating negative epigenetic markers: borderline eugenics?,"I’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts on this. 

I heard a talk the other day about how life experiences affect the epigenome and the downstream effects later in life. The main gist was that our epigenomes are very plastic early in life and will accumulate certain markers (like methylation) depending on your experience. Negative experiences (abuse, poverty, poor socioeconomic status) in particular can induce these changes, and some of these markers are linked to negative health outcomes later in life. So by growing up in a highly stressful environment, you could be at higher risk for certain diseases later in life.

One of the things the researcher proposed was that we can detect and “erase” these epigenetic markers in people. By “fixing” the epigenome, we can improve people’s health. Sounds all well and good until you think of the implications of this. If socioeconomic status is such a high indicator of certain epigenetic markers, and socioeconomic status is also very disproportionate between races, isn’t that starting to lean into the territory of eugenics?  

For example, say a certain group of people have high rates of this methylated tag, so we’re going to treat them to remove it; turns out this group is mostly minorities and impoverished people. Is that not unethical to intervene and “fix” them? That rich, happy families are fine but poor, dysfunctional families need to get treated? On one hand, it’s just an epigenetic tag; no change to the underlying DNA and was only brought about by negative experiences at no fault of the individual. But on the other hand, treating this would heavily bias people already experiencing prejudices and sounds terrible to suggest we essentially need to “cleanse” their DNA from their past.

Thing is, I live in an area where the public healthcare system is actively neglected by the premier's will to make it private (don't move to ontario). And the clinic I'm referred to has a waitlist for **years,** coupled with the condition mainly effecting women, I'm not optimistic about the health care I would receive from feedback from other women who successfully received a referral. And my province's healthcare forbids genetic testing for the condition even though it's definitive.

genetics,Uh so how does this work?,"So I have a report from 23andMe from 2018, 40x Exome Sequencing from the now defunct Genos, and 100x WGS from Nebula. 

I loaded all the VCF files into Sequencing.com and it flagged the specimen as high risk for Lynch Syndrome in the Next-Gen Disease report. I started combing through the data to see where this came from and I'm super confused.

For variant rs63750104 the report showed I as the risk variant and the detected variant as II. Looking at the data 23andMe shows I/I, Genos shows -/- and that variant isn't listed in the Nebula VCF. I assume not being listed is the same as Genos -/-. Looking at Snpedia for this variant it would appear that I;I is also a safe variant even though Sequencing.com flagged it as a risk variant. Can someone explain?

Another one is rs63750885. The report again showed I as the risk variant and the detected variant as II. And like before 23andMe shows I/I in the VCF, Genos shows -/- and it is not listed in the Nebula VCF. And again SNPedia shows both of those as fine but Sequencing.com says otherwise.

Looking at RefSNP it shows the allele as dupAT and dupG respectively (I don't know how that translate to I though, so I could use some clarification).

So given all of that, is this a problem due to the old 23andMe data mucking stuff up? Is it a problem with the report on Sequencing.com interpreting this wrong, or is it really a high risk gene and I just don't know how to read this (I'm still learning).",1clyud1

Recently though, I've been trying to understand the CRISPR-Cas9 method a bit better and can't wrap my head around palindromic DNA sequences.

Vitiligo,Vitiligo beginner guide (current treatment options) + future outlook ,"My story:

Back in 2021, when I was just 20, I spotted a small white patch on my arm. Didn't think much of it until another showed up on my face, sending me into a panic. So, off I went to see a dermatologist. But in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it appointment, he dropped the bomb: vitiligo. No cure, just learn to live with it. I cannot express to you how overwhelmed and alone I felt at that moment. When I got back home, I couldn't shake the thought of what I might look like in the future, seeing pictures of others with the condition and struggling to accept that I might end up looking like them.

Skipping ahead to 2023, my vitiligo had become more prominent and seriously bothered me. I figured I could at least try to look for something that could help me. So I spent a lot of time researching and trying out different treatments and practically visited every dermatologist in town. This post is my attempt to share what I've learned along the way, hoping it might help someone else out there facing the same challenges.


Please note:

* I will primarily focus on nonsegmental vitiligo in this post, as this is the form I have personal experience with and the one with the most available research.
* I am not a doctor. Please consult your doctor before making any changes based on the information presented here.


Dermatologist 

The first hurdle is finding a dermatologist you can really rely on. It's been quite a journey—I've been through seven different dermatologists, each time waiting months for appointments only to be quickly brushed off. But eventually, I struck gold and found a doctor who genuinely cared and was committed to helping me. Having a supportive doctor alongside you through this journey with vitiligo is an absolute game-changer. So, my advice to everyone out there is to keep pushing until you find a doctor who truly listens and cares, no matter how tough or time-consuming the search may be—it's totally worth it.

Once you've got a trustworthy doctor on your side, the next step usually involves some tests. Sadly, dealing with vitiligo often comes with an extra layer of complexity—about 20% of folks with the condition also have another autoimmune disease, and some even have multiple autoimmune conditions at once.

Unfortunately, many dermatologists, at least in my experience here in Germany, aren't always up to speed on the latest treatment options. So, I can't stress this enough: do your own research and, if needed, bring new treatment possibilities to your doctor's attention. It could make all the difference.


Tests  

The most common accompanying disease in people with vitiligo was hypothyroidism, alopecia areata, inflammatory bowel disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus. (1) (2) 

The following autoimmune diseases have also been associated with vitiligo, although less frequently: 

* Pernicious anemia, which causes low red blood cell levels
* Addison's disease, which causes low levels of the hormone cortisol
* Sjögren's syndrome, which causes dry eyes and mouth
* Dermatomyositis, which causes muscle weakness and rashes
* Scleroderma, which causes hardening and thickening of the skin
* Psoriasis, which causes scaly patches of skin

regardless of the autoimmune diseases, you should also check whether you have deficiencies of the following: 

* Vitamin D (3)
* Zinc 
* copper 
* Vitamin B12 
* folic acid
* Vitamin C

Vitamin D is by far the most common deficiency seen in patients with vitiligo, but please don't just take a supplement unless you talk to your doctor and make sure you are actually deficient because you could be doing more harm than good. 

Mental health 

Although vitiligo is only an ""aesthetic condition"" and many people act as if vitiligo is not a big deal, I have to say that it can have a very negative impact on the lives of people who suffer from it, especially during their teenage and young adult years. Depression and anxiety are very common in the vitiligo population, which is particularly sad as stress and anxiety can actually make vitiligo worse, which can lead to a vicious circle (4). That's why I can only recommend seeing a psychologist in addition to your doctor, who can help you to cope with the disease and the resulting problems.

Treatment 

First things first, I am not a doctor, please don't do anything I discuss here until you talk to your doctor first. 

What can you expect from the treatment? 

Despite ongoing research and exciting developments in vitiligo treatment, there's currently no single medication guaranteed to work for everyone. Combining different therapies often yields the best results, but these can be time-consuming and require dedication. The primary goal of current treatments is to manage and potentially improve the affected areas. A definitive cure for vitiligo isn't yet available.

Treatment options:

If you ever googled ""vitiligo treatment"" I'm sure you came across 100's of different creams, dietary supplements and things that claim to treat vitiligo, but as is so often the case in medicine, when there are 100's of treatments none of them really work. Yes, there may be the odd patient who has success with a supplement, but the sad reality is that they are likely to do very little for the rest of us. 

However, there are a few treatments that have been scientifically proven to help a large proportion of people with vitiligo and I'll introduce you to them now: 

 OPZELURA (ruxolitinib)

OPZELURA is a topical JAK inhibitor and so far the only drug approved specifically for vitiligo in Germany, where I live. It has been on the market for a short time (in Germany only since 2023) but from what I hear it is very effective. However, it seems like the cream works rather poorly on the hands.

How effective is it? 

* After 6 months, it improves facial skin color by at least 75% for about 3 in 10 people compared to 1 in 10 with placebo cream. (5)
* Results keep getting better over time. By year two, even those who didn't see much change at first can experience significant improvement. (6)
* Most people see some improvement within 3 months, with even better results between 4 months and a year. (6) 

According to the information provided, the potential side effects are rather mild: 

1. Application-site acne
2. Redness and itching at the application site
3. Inflammation of the pharynx and nasal cavities
4. Headaches
5. Urinary tract infections
6. Fever

All that sounds very promising, But, I am sure that if you ever heard about that cream you also heard how expensive it is, 1000$ for one 100g container and you probably need a lot of it, because the treatment sometimes only sets in after months. In addition, the first reports indicate that the vitiligo can come back if you stop using the cream. 

My Experience: I've been using Opzelura, covered by my health insurance, since late March 2024. While I haven't seen improvement in my vitiligo yet, some previously white hairs in the affected areas have regained their original color. I am hopeful and optimistic since I have only been using it for a short time and, as mentioned above, part of the treatment will start later. So far I have had no side effects. 

However, I have to say that applying the cream twice can be very annoying.

UVB light therapy 

UVB light therapy has been around for a while and involves directing focused UVB light onto the areas affected by vitiligo to induce repigmentation, which actually works quite well. A Meta-analysis looked at a bunch of research (35 studies) on a treatment using narrowband UV-B light (phototherapy) for the skin condition. A total of 1428 people participated in these studies. (7) 


* The good news: After at least 6 months of treatment, 7 out of 10 people (74%) saw at least some improvement in their skin condition. This improvement continued for some, with 7.5 out of 10 (75%) still showing improvement at 1 year. (7)
* Nearly a fifth (19%) of people had significant improvement after 6 months, and this number went up to over a third (36%) at 1 year. (7)
* The location of the improvement mattered. The treatment worked best on the face and neck (almost half - 44% - saw significant improvement after 6 months), followed by the torso (trunk - 26%). Legs and arms (extremities) saw some improvement (17%), but hands and feet showed little to none. (7)

The potential side-effect:

* Sunburn
* Skin irritation
* Hyperpigmentation
* Increased risk of skin cancer (go for regular check-ups!) 
* Eye damage (when used in this area) 
* Aggravation of existing skin diseases

UVB light therapy can be comparable ""cheap"" you can get good results with a UVB device for 150-300$. If your vitiligo has already affected a large part of your body, you can alternatively go to a UVB cabin, which is available in some hospitals, and has the advantage of treating the whole body directly. 

My Experience: I started with UVB in mid-2022 and after about 1 month of treatment, which I did three times a week, I started to see results that were getting better and better, but I had to stop the treatment eventually because the UVB radiation was very damaging to my ""healthy skin"", the skin around the vitiligo aged extremely quickly and you could just see that the skin was not doing well. I might try it again, but I've become really cautious since the last time. 

Topical Corticosteroids
 
The first thing a doctor prescribed me at the time was topical steroids, which are applied to the areas affected by vitiligo in a similar way to Opzelura. 

* Effectiveness: Studies show that topical corticosteroids can be helpful in repigmenting the skin and slowing down the progression of vitiligo. However, complete repigmentation is uncommon and some people may not see any improvement at all. (8)
* Best for: Topical corticosteroids are generally considered a good option for people with small, localized areas of vitiligo, especially on the face and upper body. They may also be helpful for those who want to try a different treatment option aside from sun protection and camouflage cosmetics. (8)
* Benefits: Compared to other vitiligo treatments, topical corticosteroids are relatively inexpensive, convenient to use at home, and generally well-tolerated. (8) 

The potential side-effect:

* Skin thinning (atrophy): This is a common side effect, especially with long-term use or on areas with thin skin like the face. The skin may become fragile, more susceptible to tears, and show visible blood vessels.
* Stretch marks (striae): These can appear as reddish or purple lines on the treated area.
* Visible blood vessels (telangiectasia): Thinning skin can make underlying blood vessels more noticeable.
* Excess hair growth (hypertrichosis): This is more common with use on the face.
* Burning, stinging, or inflammation (contact dermatitis): This can occur if you have sensitive skin.
* Acne: Topical steroids can sometimes trigger acne breakouts.

Topical corticosteroids offer a cost-effective approach to managing vitiligo. While they may not be highly effective for everyone, they can be helpful in slowing the spread of the white patches. Repigmentation, however, is less common with this treatment.

My Experience: I started using topical steroids shortly after my vitiligo diagnosis and used them for about 3 months, I eventually stopped because I didn't see any improvement and I wasn't really convinced of the efficacy. Furthermore, my skin didn't react well to the steroids. 

Topical calcineurin inhibitors

Topical calcineurin inhibitors are similar to topical corticosteroids, i.e. they are also applied directly to the affected area, are also very cheap, but are not particularly effective. 

Types of Calcineurin Inhibitors for Vitiligo:
* Tacrolimus (brand name Protopic): This is the most commonly used calcineurin inhibitor for vitiligo. It comes as an ointment applied directly to the skin.
* Pimecrolimus (brand name Elidel): Another option, though less commonly used for vitiligo than tacrolimus.

Advantages of Calcineurin Inhibitors over Corticosteroids:
* Fewer side effects: Compared to long-term topical corticosteroid use, calcineurin inhibitors generally have a lower risk of skin thinning and other side effects. This makes them a good choice for sensitive areas like the face, eyelids, or genitals.
* May be more effective for some: Studies suggest calcineurin inhibitors might be more effective than corticosteroids for repigmenting certain areas, particularly the face and hands. (9)

The potential side-effects:

* Burning sensation
* Increased sun sensitivity
* Potential for infections


My Experience: I used Protopic for a while but, as with the topical corticosteroids, I saw no change and finally gave up the treatment, although I have to say that I tolerated the cream better than the topical corticosteroids. 


Monobenzone

If your vitiligo is already very advanced, usually 50% or more, you could consider using Monobenzone. This is a cream that basically bleaches your healthy skin to match the vitiligo, a kind of reverse therapy, but it should be said that this change is permanent and irreversible. if you want to know more about it @TheVitiligoExperience on Youtube has made a really great video series about his treatment with the drug where he explains exactly how to use it and how it works. (10)

The potential side-effects:

* Skin irritation: This is the most common side effect of monobenzone. It can cause mild burning, itching, redness, dryness, cracking, or peeling of the treated skin. These side effects are usually temporary and go away after a few weeks of using the medication. 
* Increased sensitivity to sunlight: Monobenzone can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight. This means you're more likely to get sunburn. It's important to use sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher every day, even on cloudy days.
* Permanent hyperpigmentation: In some cases, monobenzone can cause darkening of the skin around the treated area. This is usually temporary, but it can sometimes be permanent.
* Eye problems: In rare cases, monobenzone can cause problems with your eyes, such as deposits of pigment on the cornea or conjunctiva.

My experience: My vitiligo is by no means so far advanced that this step would be an option for me.


Diet/exercise 

I know what you might be thinking, but please hear me out. I have noticed a huge improvement in my vitiligo progression after reaching a healthy weight, exercising regularly, and spending time in the sauna. And there is some scientific evidence to back this up. (11) This probably won't help with repigmentation, but it could generally help with slowing or stopping the progression of the diseases. 

Microneedling

Just like exercise and a proper diet, this will probably do very little on its own, but there is some new evidence that microneedling in combination with other treatments such as topical creams or UVB light therapy may be superior to UVB or topical creams alone. Microneedling may therefore be a good adjunct therapy to topical creams or UVB therapy. Microneedling increases absorption in the skin and activates the melanocytes in the skin. (12) (13)

Here is a guide on how you can do this: 
(14) https://drdavinlim.com/microneedling-for-vitiligo/ 

My experience: I have started to treat vitiligo with Miconeedeling since the end of March 2024 together with Opzelura to make the leather more effective. So far I can't see any results, but it's too soon to say. 

Antioxidants
The use of antioxidants to treat vitiligo is still under research, but there is evidence that some antioxidants could help in the fight against vitiligo, as oxidative stress is often observed in people with vitiligo. However it looks like antioxidant treatment should be seen more as a complementary treatment like microneedling, as it makes other treatments like topical creams or UVB work better, but is unlikely to be effective as a stand-alone treatment. (15) (16) (17) 

My experience: I started taking antioxidants a week ago after consulting my doctor and getting the green light for the treatment. Unfortunately, it's only been a week and it's too early to tell how well it's working.  


What is the best therapy? 

Again, I am not a doctor, please see your doctor first, but it seems that combining different treatments offers the greatest chance of success. 

Here is what I am doing: 

My treatment consists of a primary treatment: Opzelura and some treatments to make Opzelura more effective. 

I don't do UVB light therapy because of the effects on my skin, but I can't argue that it is very effective and you might benefit from it.

Microneedling: to increase the absorption of Opzelura in the skin and activate the melanocytes in the skin.

Antioxidants: to help with oxidative stress caused by vitiligo and support the immune system.

High-dose Vitamin D: I take 15,000 IU of vitamin D daily as I am deficient and there is some evidence that high-dose vitamin D may help with repigmentation. (18)

Maintaining a healthy weight, eating healthy, and meditating: I do this primarily to reduce the stress that could trigger disease progression and to support my immune system, and of course for general health :) 

One could also swap Opzelura for either Calcineurin Inhibitors or Topical Corticosteroids if Opzelura is not an option. 

4.) What does the future hold for the treatment of vitiligo? 

There are many different treatment options that are currently being researched, some of which I have already mentioned in the treatment section. I will now briefly introduce you to a few others: 

Oral JAK inhibitors 

In principle, this is simply the cream OPZELURA only in pill form, and the first clinical studies are already showing immense success, especially in combination with UVB. This type of treatment would of course have the advantage that you would not have to treat the individual sites individually, but simply take one pill a day. However, there are also reasons for concern because the oral administration of JAK inhibitors can have extremely serious although very rare side effects such as cancer or heart problems. (19) (20)

Antioxidants

There are several antioxidants in research right now for their role in combating vitiligo. (15) (16) (17) 


Several others are currently undergoing clinical trials:

Future outlook 

Although I don't have scientifically verifiable evidence for it, based on medical advancements, I believe that vitiligo will become a highly treatable disease in the next 5-10 years. It seems we are likely the first generation since the dawn of humanity not to be helpless in the face of this condition.


5.) Things to avoid if you have vitiligo: 

* Excessive sun exposure, keep in mind that your vitiligo has no protection against UV radiation 
* Any type of major skin trauma (hair transplant/tattoo) could trigger vitiligo in these areas


6.) How to spot your vitiligo if your skin is very pale 
Get an ultraviolet flashlight with 365nm, you can get them for less than 20 bucks on Amazon.

Vitiligo,White eyelashes/eyebrows,"Hi, 

My vitiligo seems to spread when I'm stressed hormonal or just for funsies. Anyways, when my spots spread they become so freaking itchy. Like uncontrollably itchy. My skin texture also changes too its weird. My eyes recently have seen most of the spreading and now I have sort of a racoon mask. Now to my question, my eyes have been incredibly itchy but mainly my lash line into the wet membraney part I guess you can say? Basically where my eyelashes grow is super itchy. Those of you who have white lashes and eyebrows did your eyes/eyebrows get really itchy before they turned? Did they all fall out and then grow in white? What was your experience?

Vitiligo,Guys - no one worried about carcinogen nature of UVB?,"Hi guys. I'm a mom of a 6 year old girl with vitiligo. I am mostly a lurker. We are dark brown so the contrast is stark.  We are trying to not make it a ""thing"" but also treat it. It's kind of a hard balance - but that's another story. That's not the topic of this post -

  
She responds really well to the tacro/at home UVB combo. The skin always repigments. But then new spots come.. So I feel like it is never ending.

I worry about the the UVB (or even the tacro) causing cancer down the road. I have gotten the sense on these forums that not many of you are worried about the cancer causing potential of UVB? Why or why not? 

I'm at a loss of what to do. i want her to be old enough to decide for herself, if she wants to treat it or not. She's not there yet. In the mean time, I feel it is best to treat it so that it doesn't get out of control and harder to treat later (if she wants to). 

i KNOW there is some data that suggests vitiligo patients are less likely to get melanoma. But still - isn't repetitive exposure to UVB to the point where it causes redness - isn't that worrisome for future cancer development? Have you guys talked to your doctors about it? My doctor kind of brushes off the cancer risk of it all. ",1co0mkj

I was told his patches are sensitive to the sun and after a day at school yesterday his eye patches were a bit red, will applying a heavy duty spf 50 once during the day be enough or should I be asking the school to reapply it through the day?

Vitiligo,Vitiligo reappearing?,"Hey everyone! I 22(F) think my vitiligo has returned. 
Just over 10 years ago I developed a white patch on the right side of my forehead. The doctor (a complete douchebag who scared the living daylights out of me) gasped, told me it was vitiligo, wrote it down on a piece of paper and told me to do my own research. It began spreading quickly and somehow kept getting whiter. After a while, it remained as it was and didn’t change at all (based off of this, I’m guessing it was segmental vitiligo). I’m brown so it was pretty noticeable and as a teen, I was extremely self conscious of it.

My mum found a herbal cream which I applied each night to the white patch. Within a couple of months my skin colour had come back. 

A few weeks ago I noticed a white patch forming on the bridge of my nose. It’s slowly getting worse but tbh I’m really not bothered about it. However, I now have another patch forming on my right temple.

Basically I am just looking for opinions on the question in the title. What types of studies are cancer survival rates obtained from? Late phase clinical trial? All clinical trial phases? ",1c86eu1
Oncology,Comment on: What type of studies do survival rates come from?,"I don’t think there are “official” stats that can be applied generically.

When you google survival rates for particular cancers usually it’s in context of a clinical paper that is based on a specific dataset.

The conditions of the dataset are explained in the papers themselves. Sometimes research papers are an aggregate of data from other studies, other times it’s based on proprietary data from a clinical trial run.

The terms generally repeated are progression free survival, overall survival. Those values are also framed in context of being treatment naive or having other prior lines of therapy.

In short, stats are based on the context of the paper that defined them.

——

Edit:

I saw someone else mention public records coming from a SEER registry. With modern targeted therapies against specific genetic mutations I don’t think those numbers can be relied on for all cases.

For example, take non small cell lung cancer. If you are fortunate enough to have a EGFR mutation that has a targeted therapy like osimertinib, or amivantamab you will survive much longer.

Oncology,Comment on: Seeking oncologist insights: Help us improve our personalized cancer therapy information platform,"Hello - Foundation researcher & patient navigator here who used to work in ML (computer vision).

I have experimented with LLMs (chatgpt, Gemini & llama) in the past to provide treatment guidelines for some of the cancers/biomarkers I am most familiar with from a pipeline perspective.  I found all of them to be dangerously inaccurate, but acknowledge the power of a custom-built LLM for oncology (or any other deep domain).  In that vein, I support your mission here.

That said, when approaching a new problem from an ML perspective, I've found it helpful to ask the question: ""What's the cost of getting it wrong?"" 

1. Most often, this leads to some dollar figure range or business risk discussion where the approach proceeds based on some arbitrary accuracy target for the team to achieve before a model or workflow gets deployed.
2.  Second most frequently, this question leads to an admission that 100% accuracy is desired & we have to have a frank discussion, reset expectations & explore alternatives to a black-box prediction approach. 
3. Third, the cost is found to be high (""humans might die/suffer"") & we need to add a Human-in-the-loop or expert review (HITL) for most/all predictions to limit the cost of false positives / take on liability. 
4. Least often, this question stops a project in its tracks because it is mutually agreed by both the business problem owner & the ML team that the cost of inaccuracy is too high + HITL is impractical.

For your project, I would answer this question in the third category; that is, ""the cost of getting it wrong is very high, we need to explore adding a trustworthy HITL/liability owner"".

I have tested your tool on a single case example within a pipeline I am familiar (EGFR exon20ins NSCLC).  The prompt parser accurately determined the cancer, oncogenic driver.  After that, I found it to be inaccurate + out-of-date on standard of care.  The prognosis information was also a bit strange, feels very clinically irrelevant & out-of-step with the literature I have read.  The clinical trials suggested were all over the place, many not relevant to patients with this diagnosis.  Additionally, there are multiple trials that are actually relevant to this diagnosis that were omitted.

-----

Bottom line: The cost of getting things wrong here are very high.  While positioning this as a ""physician-facing"" tool might provide that necessary HITL liability coverage, I'm concerned they are not high trust enough to derisk this tool sufficiently.  Furthermore, your ground truth / source material would need to be updated/expanded more frequently than is suggested by my single test.

All that said, I support what you're doing - bravo.  Happy to comment further privately if you want product feedback or dialogue.  I see use cases in social work, patient navigation & oncology support for a mature product here.",kwxsr8j

Apparently, this vaccine is pretty novel and the first of its kind, has low side effects, and is applied to CR1 / CR2 patients with great success in extending median OS. It's been applied mainly to AML but is being tried for a wide variety of indications. Was interested to hear what someone in the field thought. I don't know much about cancer vaccines, but as far as I understand it, only bacteria and virus based vaccines have been approved for use.

The short of it is that before we're born, we all express WT1 in kidney cells, but we no longer express this protein in normal cell function. However, cancerous cells of many types express WT1, so this vaccine is seeking it as an immunological target. 

They are specifically pairing the vaccine with existing treatments to get the best outcomes, and apparently it is showing marked improvements compared to the best available care strategies.",1bkx086

PhD researchers are a much more heterogeneous group. Some will know very little about the diagnosis and treatment of cancers even though they work in problems related to the field. For instance, someone studying the molecular pathology of a certain tumour type may not know much about diagnosis and treatment of other tumour types. Someone involved in clinical trials would again have a very different set of knowledge. They generally don’t see or treat patients unless they are MDs as well.",kujnm6w
Oncology,Comment on: MD Vs PhD - Who knows more?,"I’ll try to give some examples from my experience. Let’s say a patient is diagnosed with lung cancer.

A general oncologist vs. thoracic oncologist. Both are board certified oncologists but there isn’t a distinction between the two in terms of board certifications.

The difference is the area of focus they choose to treat and master on their own. Sometimes with additional fellowship training. 

Smaller hospitals don’t even have a thoracic oncology unit. Larger ones do. They are oncologists who choose to be hyper focused on cancers of the thorax. 

A level up is a thoracic oncologist who also participates in hosting clinical trials. This is usually done in only a select few hospitals in the country. Usually places like MD Anderson, MSK, mass general, Danafarber and  Columbia medical center.

PhDs are the “engineers” of the medical world and don’t interface with patients. They conduct their research in lab environments. Their research drives the development of an experimental cancer drug.

MD oncologists that host clinical trials at their facilities are the ones interfacing with patients, working with their hospital team to administer the clinical trial drug and report the data back to the PhDs who then analyze the data to quantify if the drug is working.

Phds are highly focused on the theoretical science and MDs are focused on the day to day practical application of widely accepted clinical research findings that have been formalized into standard treatment protocols",kuvvqko
Oncology,Comment on: MD Vs PhD - Who knows more?,"PhDs can study cancer.
Oncologists can study, diagnose, and treat cancer in a person. 

From my perspective, I don’t think a medical oncologist who is a MD would consult a PhD researcher for patient care / ask for advice for patient care in any circumstances.

A PhD researcher might ask a medical oncologist for advice or insight to help with their own research but this is not patient care.

Medical oncologists who are also researchers (again, these are MDs who are “investigators” in an oncology clinical trial) could consult and seek advice from other oncologists (MDs) for patient care but again not PhDs. 

I’m really not sure when a MD would consult a phD, except maybe for research such as if the MD was starting their own investigator initiated clinical trial.",kukyk0m
Oncology,Comment on: MD Vs PhD - Who knows more?,"Potential examples

Jim Allison (PhD) who developed cancer immunotherapy and the MDs who ran the first clinical trials for the first immunotherapy.

Brian Druker (MD) running clinical trials to use imatnib to treat BCR-ABL cancers working with the PhD scientists who developed imatnib.",kumj6ug
Oncology,Comment on: MD Vs PhD - Who knows more?,"If you’re talking about early phase clinical trials in oncology, it all depends. Was the drug made in-house or at a pharmaceutical company? If the former, there will be a little back and forth between the oncologist PI running the trial and the scientist who developed the drug. If the latter, there will be none.


By the way, there’s no such thing as a PhD in medical oncology. Oncology is the clinical practice of caring for patients with cancer. PhDs don’t take care of patients. PhDs are in scientific fields, like molecular biology. 

Also strange to ask who knows more. They are completely different degrees and careers. It’s like asking who knows more? An electrician or a plumber?

And there are a million other situations in which oncologists and PhDs ask each other for advice, like in health services delivery research. 

It’s really a strange frame to yohr question.",kumn769
Oncology,How close is the tumor?,"Hello Leute

I couldn't find useful articles on pubmed so I came here.

I’m a physiotherapist working at the Ortho clinic. A patient came to me yesterday with a heel spur & calcification in his Achilles. Shockwave therapy is the most effective in these scenarios. However, I found in the patient’s report that he has an osteochondroma near the calcification. And shockwave is a contraindication for tumors, so I prescribed him exercises and orthosis.  

My question is, did I do the right thing or is osteochondroma not a serious tumor?",1ban85p
Oncology,Defining benign ,"I have come across a Giant Cell Tumour that metastasised to lung from bone. 
I read that although they are considered “aggressive” tumours and can metastasise, they’re still considered benign. 

So my question is, what does benign actually mean?",1b96tpz
